      "Thanks, Kipp. We had another strong quarter benefiting from continued favorable market conditions and solid execution from the team. We set a new record for quarterly revenue of $4.6 billion. GAAP net income was $1 billion. Free cash flow was $923 million based on record operating cash flow of $1.6 billion less CapEx of $669 million. The investments we're making in the business are putting us in position to continue generating strong cash flow.\n",
      "We expect continued favorable market conditions for 2015, led by constrained supply in DRAM and solid demand for both the DRAM and NAND. Demand growth in our business continues to be driven by our customers' rapidly increasing memory content to enable them to enhance the performance of their products as opposed to strictly unit growth of end systems. The resulting demand outlook remains very encouraging. A few good examples of this growth include mobile DRAM, server DRAM and solid-state drives, all of which are expected to increase memory content per system by 30% to 50% in 2015.\n",
      "As just mentioned, the outlook for DRAM supply remains tight. We continue to expect industry bit growth in the low to mid-20% range in 2015, with the development of advanced process technology proving to be disruptive to wafer production. Our belief is that even with steps taken to address the otherwise declining gross wafer production in DRAM, the net wafer output in the industry will stay relatively steady or decline slightly going forward, leading to a relative stability of bit supply growth even beyond 2015.\n",
      "As we have said for some time, compared to DRAM, we expect the NAND market to have more volatility, although very attractive over the long term. We are projecting industry supply growth in the high-30% to mid-40% range for 2015, with a significant portion of the range based on deployment of TLC or triple-level cell memory. TLC has a compelling cost and price point, although there are still some variability in terms of the adoption rate for systems requiring higher performance, including certain mobile and SSD applications.\n",
      "We are often asked about the impact of 3D NAND on the industry supply. We don't believe 3D NAND will significantly change the current supply growth rate in the industry given the trade-off of more bits per wafer, offset by fewer wafers produced per fab and the capital cost associated with either planar conversion or greenfield additions. The key supply variable over the long term is the extent to which demand and economic returns dictate the need to add incremental 3D capacity.\n",
      "Micron's approach remains steadfast to focus on returns as opposed to growth or scale when we evaluate this market. We're entering an interesting year in our business, deploying evolutionary but increasingly challenging process technology in our fabs, while also moving more revolutionary technology closer to commercialization.\n",
      "We're very pleased with our recent progress on DRAM. 25-nanometer deployment has been relatively smooth and 20-nanometer enablement is well underway with many milestones being hit early. The extra R&D resources we have brought to bear and the alignment of manufacturing and R&D resources at Hiroshima are clearly bearing fruit. I'll come back to how this deployment is impacting our short term bit growth outlook in a minute.\n",
      "We also remain very comfortable with the status of our 3D NAND technology development, which, of course, is occurring in collaboration with our JV partner, Intel. 3D NAND enables cost and performance optimization beyond the capabilities of planar NAND, with enhanced product performance across a broad portfolio of applications and significant cost per bit reductions over time.\n",
      "We commenced early 3D samples in calendar Q4 of 2014 and expect volume commercial production in the second half of calendar year 2015. Given the confidence in our technology, we recently announced plans to add additional clean room space in Singapore to enable our ramp of 3D NAND as well as other emerging memory technologies. This addition effectively doubles the existing Fab 10 clean room space and once completed will create additional economies of scale for our nonvolatile memory operations in Singapore.\n",
      "The CapEx for this project is estimated to be about $4 billion spent over a number of years, with tool installs and production expected to begin in calendar '16 and calendar '17, respectively. We expect to reserve a portion of this capacity for Intel under a supply agreement.\n",
      "Note, our fiscal year 2015 CapEx guidance of $3.6 billion to $4 billion is unchanged. Spending this year on new clean room is primarily for design and early construction work.\n",
      "Our Q2 revenue guidance is $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. Keep in mind, we will be moving back to a normal 13-week quarter in Q2 from the 14-week quarter we just completed. In addition to the 13 to 14-week comparison, DRAM production is expected to be down sequentially as we prepare fabs for advanced technology deployment, including 20-nanometer and subsequent 1X and 1Y nodes, which we have on our road map. These nodes are increasingly challenging, which is a good thing in terms of industry supply outlook, but can be a short-term headwind in terms of bit shipments. This production lull is occurring in a normally seasonally slower demand period. We continue to focus on product excellence, customer service, margins and returns rather than simply shipping additional bits into the market.\n",
      "To give you an update on our longer-term bit growth, we now expect our DRAM production to come in below the market for calendar year 2015. There are several factors leading to below-market growth this year. These include: Product disruption for technology upgrades just mentioned; 20-nanometer technology, which is being deployed in calendar year '15 reduces wafer outs about 15% to 20% for a given square foot of clean room space compared to 30-nanometer. Although we are taking steps to minimize the impact, our wafers produced will decline year-over-year.\n",
      "By the way, I should note, we do have clean room space available to replace or potentially add net DRAM capacity if and when it makes sense from an ROIC standpoint, but at this time, we are not planning to make that investment.\n",
      "Finally, product mix optimization is a factor, which continues to grow in importance relative to pure bit metrics. As we diversify and optimize our business, ASP per bit, cost per bit and bit growth are all increasingly a function of these decisions. Of course, the goal is to provide the most value-added products to our customers within the constrained supply. By way of example, this year, we are shifting production from DDR3 to DDR4 and continue to grow other value-added specialty DRAM products in the mix.\n",
      "Turning to bit supply in our NAND business. Q2 is marked by a significant shift in the mix towards the mobile segment. Mobile NAND is characterized by higher ASPs, higher cost per bit and lower bit output per wafer compared to our portfolio average. These mix effects are included in the more detailed guidance Ron and Mark will provide in a minute.\n",
      "This shift in mobile or to mobile is a part of the reason our NAND bit growth will also be below the market for calendar year 2015. Of course, we were somewhat above the NAND market growth rate in 2014 following the conversion of our Singapore DRAM fab to NAND. Additionally, as I mentioned, we will begin manufacturing our 3D NAND in the second half of the year and expect what we believe is industry-leading 3D technology to have a significant and positive impact over time.\n",
      "Before I wrap up, I'd like to take a minute to discuss our partnership and supply agreement with Inotera. The supply agreement has a 3-year term, renewable on an annual basis. As with any agreement, dynamics can evolve over time and changes are sometimes required to ensure fair economics between all parties.\n",
      "At this point, we're in discussion with our partners regarding the terms for renewing the agreement, and we will provide an update when appropriate. I want to congratulate the team at Micron for a very strong quarter. We have a tremendous opportunity to continue delivering for our customers and shareholders. And we're looking forward to an exciting and productive year in 2015.\n",
      "I'll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Ronald Foster, Type: Presenter Speech\n",
      "Thanks, Mark. The first quarter of fiscal 2015 ended on December 4. We posted to our website a file containing the financial information I will cover, including GAAP and non-GAAP results, certain key metrics for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, as well as guidance for the second quarter. Our fiscal 2015 contains an extra week, as Mark mentioned, to synchronize our 52 or 53-week fiscal calendar with the August year-end. By policy, the extra week falls in our first fiscal quarter. So the first quarter of fiscal 2015 contains 14 weeks, while the rest of the quarters will contain the customary 13 weeks.\n",
      "The results of the first quarter include net income of $1,003,000,000 or $0.84 per share on net sales of $4,573,000,000. Gross margin came in at 36%, up about 3 points compared to the previous quarter. Part of this improvement is coming from higher costs in the fourth quarter related to the Tessera license and last time sale of legacy phase change memory products that we mentioned on our last call. Our reported income from equity method investments for the first quarter was $124 million, substantially all of which is attributable to Inotera.\n",
      "On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the first quarter was approximately $1.1 billion or $0.97 per share. Non-GAAP adjustments resulted in a net increased income of $135 million or $0.13 per share and included the following: The amortization of debt discount and other costs of $38 million, includes imputed interest on our convertible notes and the discount on the MMJ installment debt; the loss on restructure of debt of $30 million, related primarily to the repurchase and conversion of convertible notes in the first quarter; the $21 million loss from changes in currency exchange rates, particularly for the yen, arose from the variances in the forecasted balances of non-USD assets and liabilities that resulted in an over-hedged position in the quarter; noncash tax expense from the MMJ and MMT operations was $38 million; finally, the 27 million share anti-dilutive effect of capped calls based on the average stock price during the first quarter of $32.35.\n",
      "In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect the following significant non-GAAP adjustments: Approximately $35 million for amortization of debt discounts and convertible notes and MMJ installment debt; noncash taxes related to the Elpida acquisition are expected to be approximately $30 million in the second quarter; also the anti-dilutive effect of our capped calls will be based on the average share price for the quarter. Please refer to the convertible debt dilution table included in the earnings call data file posted on our website.\n",
      "Let's turn now to our results by technology and guidance for the second quarter. DRAM revenue increased 9% compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to an increase in bit sales volume and stable average selling prices. DRAM gross margin improved a couple of percentage points into the low 40% range. DRAM gross margins for the second quarter, using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter, should be down slightly compared to Q1 based on bit production down high single to low double-digits, ASPs flat to down low single digits and cost per bit relatively flat.\n",
      "The key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the second quarter are: Continued favorable DRAM market conditions, with like-for-like pricing generally stable to down slightly in most DRAM market segments. Mark Adams will expand on this in his comments. Lower levels of production primarily due to the normal 13-week period in Q2 and equipment upgrades in preparation for the next generation process technology, as Mark Durcan mentioned earlier.\n",
      "On the Trade NAND side, revenue increased 14% in the first quarter with a 20% increase in bit sales volume, partially offset by a 6% decrease in average selling price. Trade NAND gross margin was down slightly to the mid-20% range as cost reductions per bit partially offset decreases in selling prices.\n",
      "Trade NAND gross margins for the second quarter, using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter, are expected to be down low to mid-single digits compared to Q1 based on bit production flat to down low single digits with the normal 13-week period in Q2 as I mentioned, ASPs flat to down low single digits and cost per bit up mid-single digits, primarily relating to mix.\n",
      "Key trends for the second quarter affecting this guidance are: Like-for-like pricing is down mid-single digits, pricing pressure in the spot market and with client SSDs early in the quarter, although these markets have begun to stabilize of late, and a shift in mix to a higher concentration in mobile and managed NAND products, which has a slightly improving effect on margin, with increases in both ASP and cost per bit.\n",
      "On a consolidated basis, we're guiding total revenue for the second quarter in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion, which reflects the normal 13-week period.\n",
      "Looking at other P&L and cash flow results and guidance. SG&A expense in the second quarter is expected to be relatively stable when compared to Q1, which came in just below our guidance. R&D expense in the first quarter was below our guided range, primarily due to improved execution of product qualifications. We expect a higher level of qualification activities in the second quarter, which is contemplated in our guidance.\n",
      "Depreciation and amortization expense for the year is estimated at $2.9 billion, but will vary based on the changes in the timing of equipment receipts. As Mark mentioned, the company generated a record operating cash flow in the first quarter of $1.6 billion and ended the quarter with $5.3 billion in cash and marketable investments.\n",
      "During the first quarter, we spent $532 million on dilution management relating to our convertible notes. We also replaced our $175 million U.S. AR-backed credit line with a $600 million AR and inventory-backed credit line. No amounts have been drawn under either of these facilities.\n",
      "During the first quarter, we announced board authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. Any repurchases under the authorization would be performed opportunistically in open trading windows. There were no share repurchases during the first quarter.\n",
      "Expenditures for property, plant and equipment in the first quarter were $669 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year to be between $3.6 billion and $4 billion. Note that beginning in the first quarter, we are combining substantially all payments for property, plant and equipment into a single line in the investing section of the statement of cash flows. Historical periods are being reclassified as well to facilitate comparability. In prior periods, our disclosure of capital expenditures was the sum of expenditures for property, plant equipment and payments on equipment contracts, so there is no change in the disclosure of total capital expenditures, just a landscape change on the cash flow statement.\n",
      "We estimate that for every JPY 1 change in the U.S. dollar/yen exchange rate, our cash expenses in Japan change approximately $2.5 million. Our Q2 guidance contemplates the U.S. dollar to yen exchange rate at the end of Q1, which was approximately JPY 120 to the dollar. As a reference, the average exchange rate during the first quarter was approximately JPY 110.\n",
      "Now I'll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Presenter Speech\n",
      "Thanks, Ron. I will cover a review of our Q1 operating performance, as well as share commentary on market insights, key segment trends and memory industry dynamics as we enter calendar 2015.\n",
      "Our Computing and Networking Business Unit, referred to as CNBU, had an outstanding quarter recording $2.1 billion in revenues. Our operating margins came in at 30% compared to 26% in Q4. CNBU benefited from the slightly higher DRAM prices and lower costs, which led to the overall improved operating performance in the quarter.\n",
      "The growing diversification of our end markets is reflected in the favorable mix across our computing, server, networking, enterprise and graphics segments. Demand in the PC client segment remains strong in our first quarter. Bit shipments in client grew heading into the holidays and pricing held firm in Q1.\n",
      "We commenced volume shipments of our 25-nanometer technology into the client PC Tier 1 OEM customer base, which resulted in improved cost. Driven by continued growth in cloud computing and data analytics, we achieved both record revenue and bit shipments in our server business. Server DRAM bit growth is forecasted to grow 40% year-on-year. The growth in server-based memory is based on increasing server workloads that require higher DRAM performance and density. Our server business remains a very attractive segment with a demand profile that is less sensitive to price fluctuations in the market.\n",
      "The networking segment delivered revenue growth of up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Demand remains strong driven by LTE buildout in China and other emerging markets. We are optimistic that bandwidth requirements from increased data, audio, video and gaming content projected to grow roughly 20% in calendar year 2015 will drive higher demand from Micron's memory products in a business that yields attractive gross margins.\n",
      "Our graphics business, which is another market segment that delivers favorable ASP and margin uplift, grew Q1 revenues 18% when compared to fiscal year Q1 2014. Last year, consoles doubled their memory content per box, and we feel that there will be additional content growth this year as the use of these devices continues to expand beyond gaming into more compute and home entertainment functions. We had a strong quarter in DRAM technology enablement. We are pleased with the team's execution on DDR4 as major OEMs are in qualification for their value-added configurations.\n",
      "While coming off of a relatively low base, shipments of DDR4 increased 4x quarter-over-quarter. We are seeing very strong demand signals for DDR4 in the coming quarters, in particular from the enterprise server customer base. DDR4 ASPs remain at a significant premium to DDR3 given the enhanced performance. As the market for DDR4 begins to take shape over the next 12 months and beyond, the rate of growth should positively impact our average ASP.\n",
      "We are seeing good progress of our 8-gigabit GDDR5 technology as we're shipping engineering samples to 2 of our larger enabling partners. And finally, the research and development team saw fantastic progress in the enablement of our 20-nanometer technology DRAM process. We are evaluating ways to accelerate this transition ahead of our current plan.\n",
      "Our Storage Business Unit or SBU achieved $987 million (sic) [ $984 million ] in revenue in Q1, up 9% quarter-on-quarter. Our SBU operating margins were stable this quarter despite some challenging pricing dynamics. It appears there had been some additional TLC capacity in both the channel components and client SSD segments, which applied downward pressure on pricing towards the end of our first quarter and into our current quarter.\n",
      "As we produce primarily MLC technology, we are focused on finding higher value opportunities that require best-in-class performance and are trying to minimize our exposure to aggressive market pricing. We are making good progress in driving our SSD road map to our award-winning 16-nanometer technology. We successfully qualified the M600 drive at a Tier 1 PC OEM customer and anticipate additional commitments over the next 90 days. In addition, today, we're announcing 2 crucial branded client SSDs enabled by Micron's 16-nanometer process for shipment in this quarter. We expect to have 50% of our client SSD shipments on 16-nanometer by the end of our first quarter.\n",
      "On our last call, I outlined the steps we were taking to improve our overall NAND competitiveness, I wanted to give you an update on our progress. Our focus is in 3 areas: Process advancement, system-level enablement and higher value and market applications. We successfully hit the forecasted milestone to deliver engineering samples of our 16-nanometer TLC device by the end of calendar 2014. We are targeting late spring shipments of TLC components to the channel and consumer segments and expect to commence shipping of TLC client SSD drive into the market during the second half of 2015.\n",
      "Micron will continue to increase our leadership in overall NAND scaling demonstrated by our vertical cell 256-gigabit MLC and 384-gigabit TLC 3D NAND devices, which we believe will have the highest density per square inch of silicon in the industry. We are now sampling our 3D NAND component and remain on track for initial commercial production during the second half of calendar 2015.\n",
      "Beyond innovation at the technology level, we continue to add controller and firmware resources that are helping to accelerate product development and enhance the quality of our enterprise data center and client-based SSD products. In addition, we are investing in packaging capabilities to allow us to integrate technologies to offer performance, power and/or reliability benefits. Such capabilities are the foundation for driving into more solution-oriented products designed to meet specific customer needs.\n",
      "Finally, we are continuing to diversify our NAND business into more attractive end market applications. As an example, revenue for NAND sold into the mobile segment was up over 45% quarter-over-quarter. Coupling NAND with DRAM in the form of eMCPs is a high-growth opportunity which I will discuss in the mobile segment shortly.\n",
      "Our enterprise SSD business set a revenue record in Q1 and margins were up quarter-over-quarter as the team drove qualifications of our M500DC product into cloud and data center customers. We are evaluating options to accelerate growth into this expanding segment of the market that includes data center, cloud, networking, security, search and e-commerce customers. The fundamental for long-term growth drivers such as client, enterprise storage, mobile storage and embedded applications driving NAND consumption continues to be positive. We are meeting the milestones we set in our plan to improve the long-term operating competitiveness and feel optimistic about our position going forward.\n",
      "The Mobile Business Unit or MBU had another outstanding quarter. MBU revenue came in at $940 million. Operating margins were 33% in Q1 compared with 22% in our last quarter. We continue to see strong demand in mobile. The iPhone 6 launch was a catalyst for strong holiday demand. Memory content per device is driving customer forecast in 2015. On the high end, the Samsung Note is shipping with 3 gigabytes of low-power DRAM and Chinese competitors such as Xiaomi are differentiating with larger memory configurations.\n",
      "The low to midrange price smartphone market is driving additional memory content as well and even the feature phone segment is evolving from phones with virtually no DRAM to new products such as the Android One, which has 1 gigabyte of low-power DRAM. We are also seeing higher memory content in Flash, where mid- and high-end smartphones have shifted configurations from 32 gigabytes and 64 gigabytes to 64 gigabytes and 128 gigabytes.\n",
      "On the product front, we are growing our managed NAND business with increased shipments of the MCPs. The rapid adoption of the MCPs by the midrange market, where there is strong growth, has created a significant opportunity for Micron. With our capability of supplying known good die flow from the former Elpida operations and our 16-nanometer NAND technology, Micron is uniquely positioned to capture this growth opportunity as eMCPs move to replace eMMC in the largest mobile segments. The team is also working on low-power DDR4 enablement with our chipset partners that will allow for key customer differentiation in the future.\n",
      "As Mark and I have said in prior communications, we are focused on a returns approach to the mobile business. We are pleased with the progress the team has made to date. We are constrained to meet our customer demand forecast and continue to evaluate how to best balance our overall capacity to support Micron's valued customers.\n",
      "Our Embedded Business or EBU set a quarterly revenue record achieving $539 million in sales. This is our eighth consecutive quarter of revenue growth for EBU. Our operating margins rose to 22%, up from 16% last quarter. This growth was driven by record shipments to the automotive and industrial and multi-market segments. Automotive revenues were up 18% quarter-on-quarter. The automotive segment continues to benefit from memory content fueled by both infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems and their new offerings. Our commitment to the unique needs of this market in areas such as quality, reliability, product longevity and service have enabled us to strengthen our market leadership in Q1.\n",
      "The broad category of industrial and multi-market was up 12% quarter-over-quarter driven by continued growth in factory automation, machine-to-machine and aerospace and defense. As we see strong demand growth in areas such as automotive, infotainment, consumer electronics, connected smart homes and machine-to-machine systems, we remain optimistic for a strong demand environment in our EBU business for fiscal year 2015.\n",
      "It is worthy of note that we have recorded our fourth consecutive quarter of growth in NOR product shipments with over 4 -- 70% now on our 45-nanometer process. We will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our portfolio of DRAM, NAND and NOR to drive continued growth and profits in the embedded market.\n",
      "Coming off a strong fiscal year '14, our operations team is focused on managing through a number of transitions to ensure long-term competitiveness. On the integration front, we implemented Micron's manufacturing information systems in our fabs in both Hiroshima and Taiwan in Q1. We are also driving expanded 25-nanometer technology at MMJ and MMT. In conjunction with our R&D organization, MMJ is preparing for a second half calendar year '15 conversion to 20-nanometer, which looks very promising, with a focus on pulling in the date for volume production.\n",
      "In preparation for these technology transitions, we will see lower DRAM bit production in Q2, which will result in a small production downside already contemplated in the forecast that both Mark and Ron mentioned in their comments. The team was also busy preparing our plan for the recently announced fab expansion in Singapore, which we feel offers us the flexibility to efficiently expand 3D and emerging memory production in the future as the market conditions warrant. Finally, in the back end of our business, we signed a strategic agreement to partner with PTI to provide local assembly services on our Xi'an campus, which will both lower cost and overall cycle time.\n",
      "I would like to now briefly discuss what we are currently seeing in the market post holidays. The pricing environment for our portfolio of DRAM products remains favorable overall. We have seen modest pricing pressure in the PC segment, which is not surprising due to seasonality. Mobile DRAM pricing remains relatively stable as we remain very tight on supply in Q2.\n",
      "On the NAND front, pricing saw some softness during last month of Q1 and the first month of Q2. That being said, we have seen some signs of improved price in NAND of late, including tightness of supply in certain segments such as low-density consumer NAND. Our sense is that client SSD inventory at Tier 1 OEMs is still somewhat high post-Christmas. We also saw increasing TLC supply from what we believe to be one of our competitors, shifting NAND production away from their own internal mobile consumption to the channel and client SSD business.\n",
      "Despite these short-term pressures, which could potentially cause short-term margin compression, we feel these effects are temporary and remain bullish on the longer-term outlook for NAND, and we feel we are taking the right steps to optimize our business over the long run. As the industry converts to 3D NAND, we feel our performance and cost will continue to improve, driving accelerated adoption of NAND in the client, mobile and enterprise market segments.\n",
      "In closing, I, too, want to congratulate our team on another great quarter. We are excited about the enablement of a number of the technology advancements I referenced in my comments and feel we are well positioned for continued success in a diversifying memory business.\n",
      "With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Kipp Bedard, Type: Presenter Speech\n",
      "Thanks, Mark. And we will now take questions from callers. Karen, would you please open the lines at this time. Thank you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Operator: Operator, Type: Question and Answer Operator Message\n",
      "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts: Monika Garg, Type: Question\n",
      "First question on the NAND market, if you look at your cost decline and ASP assumptions, your NAND margins are going down again in the quarter. But the question is, why don't you delay the conversion to 3D NAND so that there's a lower bit growth in the market and let the market become even stronger before kind of adding more bits to the market? \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: D. Durcan, Type: Answer\n",
      "Monika, first of all, I would point out that the NAND market to us is really long term, very, very attractive. We see a lot of growth there, and we think it's worth investing in. Having said that, we believe that 3D is a key enabler to future leading-edge products and frankly, to long-term success in the business. And therefore, as we look at our business, we're prepared to invest in it. We haven't said a whole lot about what the rate of our ramp would be or exact timing as to when we would bring on additional supply, but we do believe it's important to get moving down the path of introducing our 3D products into the marketplace and enabling those end applications to use our products. Having said all of that, I think we've tried to be pretty clear that there is discipline in our approach. That we're going to look at the market on an ongoing basis and make sure that we don't disrupt supply. And that we think 3D is not something that is likely to be some sort of a step function sea change in terms of how Micron or other competitors in the marketplace manage their production, and that's because there are trade-offs here. As you point out, there's capital investment required, there's clean room space. And it's not -- while it's enabling and important, it's not a massive disruption that we believe will create the oversupply you're alluding to. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts: Monika Garg, Type: Question\n",
      "Just to follow-up on the Inotera. Could you provide any color on when could we expect the kind of the new -- I guess, if you negotiate the agreement with Inotera, when can we see the impact on financials? \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: D. Durcan, Type: Answer\n",
      "Yes, I don't think that there's a lot we can add to what we've already said relative to Inotera. It's a 3-year agreement, as we said before. It's renewable on an annual basis. We value the relationship. We think the other parties value the relationship. And we think that, that sets the foundation for reasonable discussion that will lead to a long-term beneficial outcome for all parties. But trying to discuss in advance when and what that might look like, I don't think is pretty productive. \n",
      "\n",
      "Operator: Operator, Type: Question and Answer Operator Message\n",
      "And our next question comes the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts: Mehdi Hosseini, Type: Question\n",
      "I have 2 on DRAM. Can you please help me understand the mix between consumer PC, server and mobile and how this mix change, changing from November into the February quarter? And then on the NAND, it's great to give us an update on the milestones, but I'm still a little bit confused what the strategy is. Are you trying to be everything to everyone or are you trying to be more focused on the specialty segment of NAND that you are pursuing? Any color there will be appreciated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Answer\n",
      "So I'll start with the first question. As it relates to the share in the DRAM segment, best to think of our PC business, the PC DRAM business somewhere in the mid-30% share wise and our mobile DRAM business somewhere in the mid-20% and servers roughly high teens. And directionally, while these things are really tough to shift in 1 quarter, you see a mild uptick as we started to shift some more capacity over to server in Q1. Mobile was roughly flat, and the server business was -- the client business, PC business was maybe down little bit. But that's roughly how it shifted and the relative size of the share in DRAM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: D. Durcan, Type: Answer\n",
      "And Mehdi, this is Mark Durcan. Maybe I'll take the NAND piece of that question. At a high level, what we said is, we want to play in a lot of different application segments for NAND, and we've acknowledged that it takes a lot of resources. And that getting the balance of those resources right requires ongoing work and that when we do a better job over the next couple of years than we've done over the last couple of years relative to how we allocate those resources. Having said that, we talked in our commentary, we feel like it's important for us to be in the mobile NAND segment. We think we have a lot of synergy with our low-power DRAM business there and with our customers. And we think there's a lot of value-added things we can do for them in the mobile segment. We can't ignore what is a very large and fast-growing segment of the market, which is the client SSD piece, and we clearly want to be in the enterprise because over the long haul, we're going to drive significant value there. So we will continue to deploy our resources across a number of different application segments and then allocate our capacity as we see progress in all those different segments. \n",

      "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Markets. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts: Doug Freedman, Type: Question\n",
      "When I look at your guidance, it assumes a little bit of a challenging environment for you in terms of cost declines. Can you maybe walk us through what is happening over at Inotera with the node migration? And what, if any, impact that will have on the DRAM cost per bit? \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: D. Durcan, Type: Answer\n",
      "Yes, Doug, maybe I'll take that. As I mentioned, mix is an increasingly important piece of the answer in all these questions because as we move to more value-added applications, that's going to drive different bit growth. Think about DDR4 to DDR -- DDR3 to DDR4, there's a 10% to 15% die size better moving to that technology depending on exactly how you're positioned. That's going to mitigate bit growth in the year, but it's going to probably drive value. The customers certainly see a lot of value in getting the DDR4 today. Likewise, as we move to more differentiated products to service networking and high-performance computing and move more of our mix in that direction, we won't see the cost declines we've seen in the past, but hopefully, we'll see value add recognized by the customer. Beyond that, I would say there's not a lot structurally that would change here, other than you should recognize that Micron today is deploying capital to support a 20-nanometer ramp that is a large productivity step. And anytime you deploy capital, you don't get a return instantaneously. It takes a while for that capital to become installed and productive and for the line to be loaded and moved to inventory and out in the marketplace. And so you have to contemplate that a little bit as 2015 is an exciting year for us in terms of technology deployment. \n",

      "Analysts: Steven Fox, Type: Question\n",
      "Two questions for me, just to dig in a little bit more on the client SSD market. How much -- can you just sort of go into some color as to how much of the competitiveness you're seeing is temporary. And then from a Micron standpoint, how much gets kind of fixed as you roll out your TLC product or is there other things that you can do to improve margins there? And then secondly, if you could just sort of give us a little bit more of a color around the DDR4 timing of the ramp and how that's going to affect your mix and margins because I guess I was of the impression maybe it was going to move, and we'll start to see it more in the quarter we're in now. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Answer\n",
      "So on the SSD side, we started to see kind of preholiday inventory build at the key customers, and we truly do believe it's a temporary piece of the market dynamics in NAND. What we have been seeing, as I said, over the last week or so, is that the NAND pricing actually stabilized a bit. In some segments, it's gone up. So relative to the question on TLC competitiveness, yes, as we bring those products to market, as I mentioned in my comments early in the second half of calendar year '15, we do expect to be able to compete more favorably, and we'll then be able to drive more of our mix to the TLC SSD client products. At this point, as we look at our opportunities there, we're just being careful not to try to compete with lower-cost products when we can take these MLC products and try to pursue better higher value homes. On the DDR ramp, as I said earlier, we're pleased with the ramp, albeit early. And we think it's reasonable to see by the end of our fiscal year somewhere in the area of 30% plus or minus of our server bits will be DDR4 and really the market -- we'll let the market dictate what that looks like as far as the ramp and the scale. \n",

      "Let me take the last bit of that John, and then Maybe Mark can take the first part, Mark Adams can take the first part. Yes, I think we will see, as we move out in time, get back to sort of a more normal bit growth rate quarter-over-quarter. As I mentioned just a minute ago, when you deploy technology, sometimes there's disruptions in manufacturing. In particular, you want to make sure you're facilitating all the equipment to have legs out in the time and then as you deploy that technology, you don't necessarily get the bits and the output immediately. So yes, we would anticipate being back on a more normal trajectory further out in the year. \n",

      "Executives: D. Durcan, Type: Answer\n",
      "Oh, well, we didn't have a whole lot of position in that, but it kind of depends on the mix of DDR4 we put out into the marketplace and exactly how we progress with some of these specialty products I was talking about. We said sort of for the market in the low to mid-20s, and we think we'll probably be 20% plus or minus, but a little bit below it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts: John Pitzer, Type: Question\n",
      "And then guys on the NAND profitability side, you guys have been working hard over the last 12 months to improve that. One of the arguments was that you were just selling bits into the wrong market and as mix improved, you'd start to see the margin benefit. You're starting to see that mix improvement. It sounded like in your prepared comments that the move to mobile is accretive, but not a big enough move in mix yet to actually drive gross margins higher. Can you help me understand where the mix of mobile in NAND is today? And given where you think that mix is going to go, are you confident in thinking that February might be the gross margin trough for the NAND? \n",

      "Can I just make a comment on the front part when you talked about the product mix, John. Mind you, these things are not necessarily things that shift dramatically in a quarter, but to your point, you'll see mobile as a percent of our overall NAND business just quarter-over-quarter, almost double in terms of the share of the business, up close to 20 -- almost slightly 20%, slightly below 20% of our NAND business. And then you'll see a healthy shift away from our cars and component business as we do this and find better homes, and we'll continue to look at ways to drive enterprise storage and client SSDs for those markets that make sense. Mark made an interesting comment in his prepared statement today that, we are finding customers that are not totally invested in TLC for their client SSDs, where they're finding higher performance requirements or just simply reliability issues that they don't want to bet on in TLC. And so we're going to continue to drive our customers to evaluate our higher-performing MLC-based client SSD storage as we drive that forward as well. And so that should be the trend you see, mobile, a shift away from channel and driving more enterprise and high-performance client SSD. \n",

      "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Newman from Bernstein. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts: Mark Newman, Type: Question\n",
      "The results on DRAM continue to do very, very well, continue to be much stronger than expected actually. When I think, if I could summarize what you're saying, we think that the market is going to be strong and tight, and that's going to continue throughout 2015, but looking at NAND obviously continues to disappoint, I think, with gross margins down and looks like you're projecting down again next quarter. So the question really I have for you, and some of it you've already talked about, but I want to ask more specifically, do you think this is -- this somewhat disappointment on the NAND side, I would say, or delay in the recovery, it seems to be, is it related to the market being worse than expected due to oversupply in the market or is it difficulties on execution? And what kind of timing should we expect for some improvement on the NAND side? It seems like the NAND recovery always seems to be about 2 quarters off. Obviously, TLC, SSDs, both have been mentioned as a big part of that solution. Now it seems like you're moving some of your mix to mobile, so I'd like to understand what the updated plan really is to improve the profitability of the NAND. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Answer\n",
      "Mark, this is Mark Adams. Thanks for the question. A couple of things. If you've looked back over the last couple of quarters, on a relative basis, our margins had held pretty stable relative to our competition, actually closing -- increment in closing the gap a little bit. Now we're not satisfied with that by any stretch, but those are some data points. This quarter, again, gross margin was pretty flat in a relatively tough period for NAND and the market dynamic. So as a backdrop to your question, that's what we're up against. When you talked about kind of a confusing or changing strategy, I don't think that's the case. Please don't mix TLC with where the end application products go. You had mentioned TLC and now shift to mobile. Actually, mobile, enterprise and client SSDs were always part of our strategy and continue to be part of our strategy. TLC is the technology foundation for what will enable low-cost solutions in the market, and we're investing in that. Over the last year, both Mark and myself had made comments to the tune of sampling at the end of the calendar year. That's in place. We've done that. We're in process and starting qualifications. We said components and in consumer applications, we'd be shipping late spring, end of the calendar second quarter, and we'd be launching client-based SSD drives with TLC. Those are all tactics to the strategy of deploying TLC where it make sense in the market. That's not the whole story. Using our DRAM and NAND technology, the known good die flow from Elpida, combined with our technology in MLC and eventually TLC, we're going to launch and develop the mobile market. We're going to continue investing in controllers and firmware and software technology to advance both enterprise and client SSDs. We don't see TLC in the enterprise just yet. We'll continue to evaluate that path, but that's an end market. It has nothing to do with TLC or MLC. And on the client side, same thing, we're going to still make client MLC drives. But in markets that are looking for lower-cost alternatives and willing to sacrifice in performance, we'll deploy a TLC. So those areas of mobile and enterprise and client storage are our 3 pillars of where we're investing to drive applications. And the technology, whether it be MLC or TLC, is the core to how we get there. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts: Mark Newman, Type: Question\n",
      "That's very, very helpful. Which area do you think is more -- how would you order the margins for Micron amongst the businesses in NAND out of client SSD, enterprise SSD, mobile and everything else? How would you order those? \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Answer\n",
      "I think the best way to look at it is, enterprise SSDs are likely to garner the highest margins. Mobile would probably be second. And client SSDs, third of those 3. And then there still is healthy in terms of volume is the components channel out there for consumer applications and embedded applications and so on and so forth. So that can vary depending on the overall market dynamics. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts: Mark Newman, Type: Question\n",
      "I see. And then looking forward to later on this year, do we expect that the market is going to become healthier in NAND Flash? Do we need to expect -- do we need to see a healthier market in NAND for margins to get back up significantly higher than this, do you think? \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Answer\n",
      "Well, as we -- it's always tough to project. I would say, I want to caution you. The gut feel right now based on the feedback from our customers is that NAND is going to be relatively tight. Now when we talk about this changing business we're in, it doesn't mean that you won't have small periods, temporary periods where there's an oversupply in a certain segment of the market, whether it be a client SSD issue, whether it be something else. And so we think overall, with the growth and demand drivers in mobile, enterprise and client that overall we think it's going to be in pretty good shape. And the type of demand forecast we're seeing from our customers suggests that things will remain in balance and be pretty positive in the remainder of our fiscal year. \n",

      "Analysts: Daniel Amir, Type: Question\n",
      "So I was wondering here, what has basically changed maybe from your perspective in the past 90 days? Is it more of the DRAM business or more of the NAND business because it certainly look like that 90 days ago there was more of a thought here that the NAND business might be in a change, demand remains pretty solid for DRAM. But now, you're looking at maybe lower bit growth here. So has something surprised you on the negative side or was this kind of the thought process 90 days ago on the business? \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Answer\n",
      "Sure. Thanks for the question. The way I would answer that is, we don't see any structural change in the business. On the NAND side, we do believe there was some shifting of some capacity, some competitors into -- away from certain segments and into the kind of low volume segments that hit pricing a little bit on the spot market in the client, entry-level client devices and what have you. But we don't see any structure there. We think actually, we're very bullish still on the NAND demand side of the business. And the DRAM piece, I think Mark spoke to the rationale behind what drove our decisions to making the DRAM capacity long-term decisions and investments. And so we still think it's a very good business, very stable and the ASPs are relatively flat, and we're still pretty positive. \n",

      "Thanks, Kipp. We had another strong quarter benefiting from continued favorable market conditions and solid execution from the team. We set a new record for quarterly revenue of $4.6 billion. GAAP net income was $1 billion. Free cash flow was $923 million based on record operating cash flow of $1.6 billion less CapEx of $669 million. The investments we're making in the business are putting us in position to continue generating strong cash flow.\n",
      "We expect continued favorable market conditions for 2015, led by constrained supply in DRAM and solid demand for both DRAM and NAND. Demand growth in our business continues to be driven by our customers' rapidly increasing memory content to enable them to enhance the performance of their products as opposed to strictly unit growth of end systems. The resulting demand outlook remains very encouraging. A few good examples of this growth include mobile DRAM, server DRAM and solid-state drives, all of which are expected to increase memory content per system by 30% to 50% in 2015.\n",
      "As just mentioned, the outlook for DRAM supply remains tight. We continue to expect industry bit growth in the low- to mid-20% range in 2015, with the development of advanced process technology proving to be disruptive to wafer production. Our belief is that even with steps taken to address the otherwise declining gross wafer production in DRAM, the net wafer output in the industry will stay relatively steady or decline slightly going forward, leading to a relative stability of bit supply growth even beyond 2015.\n",
      "As we have said for some time, compared to DRAM, we expect the NAND market to have more volatility, although very attractive over the long term. We are projecting industry supply growth in the high-30% to mid-40% range for 2015, with a significant portion of the range based on deployment of TLC or triple-level cell memory. TLC has a compelling cost and price point, although there is still some variability in terms of the adoption rate for systems requiring higher performance, including certain mobile and SSD applications.\n",
      "We are often asked about the impact of 3D NAND on the industry supply. We don't believe 3D NAND will significantly change the current supply growth rate in the industry given the trade-off of more bits per wafer, offset by fewer wafers produced per fab and the capital cost associated with either planar conversion or greenfield additions. The key supply variable over the long term is the extent to which demand and economic returns dictate the need to add incremental 3D capacity.\n",
      "Micron's approach remains steadfast to focus on returns, as opposed to growth or scale, when we evaluate this market. We're entering an interesting year in our business, deploying evolutionary but increasingly challenging process technology in our fabs, while also moving more revolutionary technology closer to commercialization.\n",
      "We're very pleased with our recent progress on DRAM. 25-nanometer deployment has been relatively smooth and 20-nanometer enablement is well underway with many milestones being hit early. The extra R&D resources we have brought to bear and the alignment of manufacturing and R&D resources at Hiroshima are clearly bearing fruit. I'll come back to how this deployment is impacting our short term bit growth outlook in a minute.\n",
      "We also remain very comfortable with the status of our 3D NAND technology development, which, of course, is occurring in collaboration with our JV partner, Intel. 3D NAND enables cost and performance optimization beyond the capabilities of planar NAND, with enhanced product performance across a broad portfolio of applications and significant cost-per-bit reductions over time.\n",
      "We commenced early 3D samples in calendar Q4 of 2014, and expect volume commercial production in the second half of calendar year 2015. Given the confidence in our technology, we recently announced plans to add additional clean room space in Singapore to enable our ramp of 3D NAND as well as other emerging memory technologies. This addition effectively doubles the existing Fab 10 clean room space and once completed will create additional economies of scale for our nonvolatile memory operations in Singapore.\n",
      "The CapEx for this project is estimated to be about $4 billion spent over a number of years, with tool installs and production expected to begin in calendar '16 and calendar '17, respectively. We expect to reserve a portion of this capacity for Intel under a supply agreement.\n",
      "Note, our fiscal year 2015 CapEx guidance of $3.6 billion to $4 billion is unchanged, as spending this year on new clean room is primarily for design and early construction work.\n",
      "Our Q2 revenue guidance is $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. Keep in mind, we will be moving back to a normal 13-week quarter in Q2 from the 14-week quarter we just completed. In addition to the 13 to 14-week comparison, DRAM production is expected to be down sequentially as we prepare fabs for advanced technology deployment, including 20-nanometer and subsequent 1X and 1Y nodes, which we have on our road map. These nodes are increasingly challenging, which is a good thing in terms of industry supply outlook, but can be a short-term headwind in terms of bit shipments. This production lull is occurring in a normally seasonally slower demand period. We continue to focus on product excellence, customer service, margins and returns rather than simply shipping additional bits into the market.\n",
      "To give you an update on our longer-term bit growth, we now expect our DRAM production to come in below the market for calendar year 2015. There are several factors leading to below-market growth this year. These include: Product disruption for technology upgrades just mentioned; 20-nanometer technology, which is being deployed in calendar year '15, reduces wafer outs about 15% to 20% for a given square foot of clean room space compared to 30-nanometer. Although we are taking steps to minimize the impact, our wafers produced will decline year-over-year.\n",
      "By the way, I should note, we do have clean room space available to replace or potentially add net DRAM capacity if and when it makes sense from an ROIC standpoint, but at this time, we are not planning to make that investment.\n",
      "Finally, product mix optimization is a factor which continues to grow in importance relative to pure bit metrics. As we diversify and optimize our business, ASP per bit, cost per bit and bit growth are all increasingly a function of these decisions. Of course, the goal is to provide the most value-added products to our customers within the constrained supply. By way of example, this year, we are shifting production from DDR3 to DDR4 and continue to grow other value-added specialty DRAM products in the mix.\n",
      "Turning to bit supply in our NAND business. Q2 is marked by a significant shift in the mix towards the mobile segment. Mobile NAND is characterized by higher ASPs, higher cost per bit and lower bit output per wafer compared to our portfolio average. These mix effects are included in the more detailed guidance Ron and Mark will provide in a minute.\n",
      "This shift in mobile -- or to mobile is a part of the reason our NAND bit growth will also be below the market for calendar year 2015. Of course, we were somewhat above the NAND market growth rate in 2014 following the conversion of our Singapore DRAM fab to NAND. Additionally, as I mentioned, we will begin manufacturing our 3D NAND in the second half of the year, and expect what we believe is industry-leading 3D technology to have a significant and positive impact over time.\n",
      "Before I wrap up, I'd like to take a minute to discuss our partnership and supply agreement with Inotera. The supply agreement has a 3-year term, renewable on an annual basis. As with any agreement, dynamics can evolve over time and changes are sometimes required to ensure fair economics between all parties.\n",
      "At this point, we're in discussion with our partners regarding the terms for renewing the agreement, and we will provide an update when appropriate. I want to congratulate the team at Micron for a very strong quarter. We have a tremendous opportunity to continue delivering for our customers and shareholders. And we're looking forward to an exciting and productive year in 2015.\n",
      "I'll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A. \n",

      "Thanks, Mark. The first quarter of fiscal 2015 ended on December 4. We posted to our website a file containing the financial information I will cover, including GAAP and non-GAAP results, certain key metrics for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, as well as guidance for the second quarter. Our fiscal 2015 contains an extra week, as Mark mentioned, to synchronize our 52 or 53-week fiscal calendar with the August year-end. By policy, the extra week falls in our first fiscal quarter. So the first quarter of fiscal 2015 contains 14 weeks, while the rest of the quarters will contain the customary 13 weeks.\n",
      "The results of the first quarter include net income of $1,003,000,000 or $0.84 per share on net sales of $4,573,000,000. Gross margin came in at 36%, up about 3 points compared to the previous quarter. Part of this improvement is coming from higher costs in the fourth quarter related to the Tessera license and last-time sale of legacy phase change memory products that we mentioned on our last call. Our reported income from equity method investments for the first quarter was $124 million, substantially all of which is attributable to Inotera.\n",
      "On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the first quarter was approximately $1.1 billion or $0.97 per share. Non-GAAP adjustments resulted in a net increased income of $135 million or $0.13 per share and included the following: The amortization of debt discount and other costs of $38 million, includes imputed interest on our convertible notes and the discount on the MMJ installment debt; the loss on restructure of debt of $30 million, related primarily to the repurchase and conversion of convertible notes in the first quarter; the $21 million loss from changes in currency exchange rates, particularly for the yen, arose from the variances in the forecasted balances of non-USD assets and liabilities that resulted in an over-hedged position in the quarter; noncash tax expense from the MMJ and MMT operations was $38 million; finally, the 27 million share anti-dilutive effect of capped calls based on the average stock price during the first quarter of $32.35.\n",
      "In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect the following significant non-GAAP adjustments: Approximately $35 million for amortization of debt discounts and convertible notes and MMJ installment debt; noncash taxes related to the Elpida acquisition are expected to be approximately $30 million in the second quarter; also the anti-dilutive effect of our capped calls will be based on the average share price for the quarter.

DRAM revenue increased 9% compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to an increase in bit sales volume and stable average selling prices. DRAM gross margin improved a couple of percentage points into the low 40% range. DRAM gross margins for the second quarter, using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter, should be down slightly compared to Q1 based on bit production down high-single to low-double digits, ASPs flat to down low-single digits and cost per bit relatively flat.\n",
      "The key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the second quarter are: Continued favorable DRAM market conditions, with like-for-like pricing generally stable to down slightly in most DRAM market segments, Mark Adams will expand on this in his comments; lower levels of production primarily due to the normal 13-week period in Q2; and equipment upgrades in preparation for the next generation process technology, as Mark Durcan mentioned earlier.\n",
      "On the Trade NAND side, revenue increased 14% in the first quarter, with a 20% increase in bit sales volume partially offset by a 6% decrease in average selling price. Trade NAND gross margin was down slightly to the mid-20% range, as cost reductions per bit partially offset decreases in selling prices.\n",
      "Trade NAND gross margins for the second quarter, using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter, are expected to be down low- to mid-single digits compared to Q1 based on bit production flat to down low-single digits with the normal 13-week period in Q2, as I mentioned; ASPs flat to down low-single digits; and cost per bit up mid-single digits, primarily relating to mix.\n",
      "Key trends for the second quarter affecting this guidance are: Like-for-like pricing is down mid-single digits; pricing pressure in the spot market and with client SSDs early in the quarter, although these markets have begun to stabilize of late; and a shift in mix to a higher concentration in mobile and managed NAND products, which has a slightly improving effect on margin, with increases in both ASP and cost per bit.\n",
      "On a consolidated basis, we're guiding total revenue for the second quarter in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion, which reflects the normal 13-week period.\n",
      "Looking at other P&L and cash flow results and guidance. SG&A expense in the second quarter is expected to be relatively stable when compared to Q1, which came in just below our guidance. R&D expense in the first quarter was below our guided range, primarily due to improved execution of product qualifications. We expect a higher level of qualification activities in the second quarter, which is contemplated in our guidance.\n",
      "Depreciation and amortization expense for the year is estimated at $2.9 billion, but will vary based on the changes in the timing of equipment receipts. As Mark mentioned, the company generated a record operating cash flow in the first quarter of $1.6 billion and ended the quarter with $5.3 billion in cash and marketable investments.\n",
      "During the first quarter, we spent $532 million on dilution management relating to our convertible notes. We also replaced our $175 million U.S. AR-backed credit line with a $600 million AR and inventory-backed credit line. No amounts have been drawn under either of these facilities.\n",
      "During the first quarter, we announced board authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. Any repurchases under the authorization would be performed opportunistically in open trading windows. There were no share repurchases during the first quarter.\n",
      "Expenditures for property, plant and equipment in the first quarter were $669 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year to be between $3.6 billion and $4 billion. Note that beginning in the first quarter, we are combining substantially all payments for property, plant and equipment into a single line in the investing section of the statement of cash flows. Historical periods are being reclassified as well to facilitate comparability. In prior periods, our disclosure of capital expenditures was the sum of expenditures for property, plant and equipment and payments on equipment contracts, so there is no change in the disclosure of total capital expenditures, just a landscape change on the cash flow statement.\n",
      "We estimate that for every JPY 1 change in the U.S. dollar/yen exchange rate, our cash expenses in Japan change approximately $2.5 million. Our Q2 guidance contemplates the U.S. dollar to yen exchange rate at the end of Q1, which was approximately JPY 120 to the dollar. As a reference, the average exchange rate during the first quarter was approximately JPY 110.\n",
      "Now I'll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Presenter Speech\n",
      "Thanks, Ron. I will cover a review of our Q1 operating performance, as well as share commentary on market insights, key segment trends and memory industry dynamics as we enter calendar 2015.\n",
      "Our Computing and Networking Business Unit, referred to as CNBU, had an outstanding quarter recording $2.1 billion in revenues. Our operating margins came in at 30% compared to 26% in Q4. CNBU benefited from the slightly higher DRAM prices and lower costs, which led to the overall improved operating performance in the quarter.\n",
      "The growing diversification of our end markets is reflected in the favorable mix across our computing, server, networking, enterprise and graphics segments. Demand in the PC client segment remained strong in our first quarter. Bit shipments in client grew heading into the holidays and pricing held firm in Q1.\n",
      "We commenced volume shipments of our 25-nanometer technology into the client PC Tier 1 OEM customer base, which resulted in improved cost. Driven by continued growth in cloud computing and data analytics, we achieved both record revenue and bit shipments in our server business. Server DRAM bit growth is forecasted to grow 40% year-on-year. The growth in server-based memory is based on increasing server workloads that require higher DRAM performance and density. Our server business remains a very attractive segment with a demand profile that is less sensitive to price fluctuations in the market.\n",
      "The networking segment delivered revenue growth of up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Demand remains strong, driven by LTE buildout in China and other emerging markets. We are optimistic that bandwidth requirements from increased data, audio, video and gaming content, projected to grow roughly 20% in calendar year 2015, will drive higher demand for Micron's memory products in a business that yields attractive gross margins.\n",
      "Our graphics business, which is another market segment that delivers favorable ASP and margin uplift, grew Q1 revenues 18% when compared to fiscal year Q1 2014. Last year, consoles doubled their memory content per box, and we feel that there will be additional content growth this year as the use of these devices continues to expand beyond gaming into more compute and home entertainment functions. We had a strong quarter in DRAM technology enablement. We are pleased with the team's execution on DDR4, as major OEMs are in qualification for their value-added configurations.\n",
      "While coming off of a relatively low base, shipments of DDR4 increased 4x quarter-over-quarter. We are seeing very strong demand signals for DDR4 in the coming quarters, in particular from the enterprise server customer base. DDR4 ASPs remain at a significant premium to DDR3 given the enhanced performance. As the market for DDR4 begins to take shape over the next 12 months and beyond, the rate of growth should positively impact our average ASP.\n",
      "We are seeing good progress of our 8-gigabit GDDR5 technology, as we're shipping engineering samples to 2 of our larger enabling partners. And finally, the research and development team saw fantastic progress in the enablement of our 20-nanometer technology DRAM process. We are evaluating ways to accelerate this transition ahead of our current plan.\n",
      "Our Storage Business Unit or SBU achieved $987 million (sic) [ $984 million ] in revenue in Q1, up 9% quarter-on-quarter. Our SBU operating margins were stable this quarter despite some challenging pricing dynamics. It appears there had been some additional TLC capacity in both the channel components and client SSD segments, which applied downward pressure on pricing towards the end of our first quarter and into our current quarter.\n",
      "As we produce primarily MLC technology, we are focused on finding higher value opportunities that require best-in-class performance, and are trying to minimize our exposure to aggressive market pricing. We are making good progress in driving our SSD road map to our award-winning 16-nanometer technology. We successfully qualified the M600 drive at a Tier 1 PC OEM customer and anticipate additional commitments over the next 90 days. In addition, today, we're announcing 2 crucial branded client SSDs enabled by Micron's 16-nanometer process for shipment in this quarter. We expect to have 50% of our client SSD shipments on 16-nanometer by the end of our first quarter.\n",
      "On our last call, I outlined the steps we were taking to improve our overall NAND competitiveness. I wanted to give you an update on our progress. Our focus is in 3 areas: Process advancement, system-level enablement and higher value end-market applications. We successfully hit the forecasted milestone to deliver engineering samples of our 16-nanometer TLC device by the end of calendar 2014. We are targeting late spring shipments of TLC components to the channel and consumer segments and expect to commence shipping of TLC client SSD drives into the market during the second half of 2015.\n",
      "Micron will continue to increase our leadership in overall NAND scaling, demonstrated by our vertical cell 256-gigabit MLC and 384-gigabit TLC 3D NAND devices, which we believe will have the highest density per square inch of silicon in the industry. We are now sampling our 3D NAND component and remain on track for initial commercial production during the second half of calendar 2015.\n",
      "Beyond innovation at the technology level, we continue to add controller and firmware resources that are helping to accelerate product development and enhance the quality of our enterprise data center and client-based SSD products. In addition, we are investing in packaging capabilities to allow us to integrate technologies to offer performance, power and/or reliability benefits. Such capabilities are the foundation for driving into more solution-oriented products designed to meet specific customer needs.\n",
      "Finally, we are continuing to diversify our NAND business into more attractive end-market applications. As an example, revenue for NAND sold into the mobile segment was up over 45% quarter-over-quarter. Coupling NAND with DRAM in the form of eMCPs is a high-growth opportunity, which I will discuss in the mobile segment shortly.\n",
      "Our enterprise SSD business set a revenue record in Q1, and margins were up quarter-over-quarter as the team drove qualifications of our M500DC product into cloud and data center customers. We are evaluating options to accelerate growth into this expanding segment of the market that includes data center, cloud, networking, security, search and e-commerce customers. The fundamental for long-term growth drivers such as client, enterprise storage, mobile storage and embedded applications driving NAND consumption continues to be positive. We are meeting the milestones we set in our plan to improve the long-term operating competitiveness and feel optimistic about our position going forward.\n",
      "The Mobile Business Unit or MBU had another outstanding quarter. MBU revenue came in at $940 million. Operating margins were 33% in Q1 compared with 22% in our last quarter. We continue to see strong demand in mobile. The iPhone 6 launch was a catalyst for strong holiday demand. Memory content per device is driving customer forecast in 2015. On the high end, the Samsung Note is shipping with 3 gigabytes of low-power DRAM, and Chinese competitors such as Xiaomi are differentiating with larger memory configurations.\n",
      "The low to midrange price smartphone market is driving additional memory content as well, and even the feature phone segment is evolving from phones with virtually no DRAM to new products such as the Android One, which has 1 gigabyte of low-power DRAM. We are also seeing higher memory content in Flash, where mid- and high-end smartphones have shifted configurations from 32 gigabytes and 64 gigabytes to 64 gigabytes and 128 gigabytes.\n",
      "On the product front, we are growing our managed NAND business with increased shipments of the MCPs. The rapid adoption of the MCPs by the midrange market, where there is strong growth, has created a significant opportunity for Micron. With our capability of supplying known good die flow from the former Elpida operations and our 16-nanometer NAND technology, Micron is uniquely positioned to capture this growth opportunity as eMCPs move to replace eMMC in the largest mobile segments. The team is also working on low-power DDR4 enablement with our chipset partners that will allow for key customer differentiation in the future.\n",
      "As Mark and I have said in prior communications, we are focused on a returns approach to the mobile business. We are pleased with the progress the team has made to date. We are constrained to meet our customer demand forecast and continue to evaluate how to best balance our overall capacity to support Micron's valued customers.\n",
      "Our Embedded Business or EBU set a quarterly revenue record achieving $539 million in sales. This is our eighth consecutive quarter of revenue growth for EBU. Our operating margins rose to 22%, up from 16% last quarter. This growth was driven by record shipments to the automotive and industrial and multi-market segments. Automotive revenues were up 18% quarter-on-quarter. The automotive segment continues to benefit from memory content fueled by both infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems and their new offerings. Our commitment to the unique needs of this market in areas such as quality, reliability, product longevity and service have enabled us to strengthen our market leadership in Q1.\n",
      "The broad category of industrial and multi-market was up 12% quarter-over-quarter, driven by continued growth in factory automation, machine-to-machine and aerospace and defense. As we see strong demand growth in areas such as automotive infotainment, consumer electronics, connected smart homes and machine-to-machine systems, we remain optimistic for a strong demand environment in our EBU business for fiscal year 2015.\n",
      "It is worthy of note that we have recorded our fourth consecutive quarter of growth in NOR product shipments, with over 4 -- 70% now on our 45-nanometer process. We will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our portfolio of DRAM, NAND and NOR to drive continued growth and profits in the embedded market.\n",
      "Coming off a strong fiscal year '14, our operations team is focused on managing through a number of transitions to ensure long-term competitiveness. On the integration front, we implemented Micron's manufacturing information systems in our fabs in both Hiroshima and Taiwan in Q1. We are also driving expanded 25-nanometer technology at MMJ and MMT. In conjunction with our R&D organization, MMJ is preparing for a second half calendar year '15 conversion to 20-nanometer, which looks very promising, with a focus on pulling in the date for volume production.\n",
      "In preparation for these technology transitions, we will see lower DRAM bit production in Q2, which will result in a small production downside already contemplated in the forecast that both Mark and Ron mentioned in their comments. The team was also busy preparing our plan for the recently announced fab expansion in Singapore, which we feel offers us the flexibility to efficiently expand 3D and emerging memory production in the future as the market conditions warrant. Finally, in the back end of our business, we signed a strategic agreement to partner with PTI to provide local assembly services on our Xi'an campus, which will both lower cost and overall cycle time.\n",
      "I would like to now briefly discuss what we are currently seeing in the market post holidays. The pricing environment for our portfolio of DRAM products remains favorable overall. We have seen modest pricing pressure in the PC segment, which is not surprising due to seasonality. Mobile DRAM pricing remains relatively stable as we remain very tight on supply in Q2.\n",
      "On the NAND front, pricing saw some softness during last month of Q1 and the first month of Q2. That being said, we have seen some signs of improved price in NAND of late, including tightness of supply in certain segments such as low-density consumer NAND. Our sense is that client SSD inventory at Tier 1 OEMs is still somewhat high post-Christmas. We also saw increasing TLC supply from what we believe to be one of our competitors shifting NAND production away from their own internal mobile consumption to the channel and client SSD business.\n",
      "Despite these short-term pressures, which could potentially cause short-term margin compression, we feel these effects are temporary and remain bullish on the longer-term outlook for NAND, and we feel we are taking the right steps to optimize our business over the long run. As the industry converts to 3D NAND, we feel our performance and cost will continue to improve, driving accelerated adoption of NAND in the client, mobile and enterprise market segments.\n",
      "In closing, I, too, want to congratulate our team on another great quarter. We are excited about the enablement of a number of the technology advancements I referenced in my comments and feel we are well positioned for continued success in a diversifying memory business.\n",
      "With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts: Monika Garg, Type: Question\n",
      "First question on the NAND market. If you look at your cost decline and ASP assumptions, your NAND margins are going down again in the quarter. But the question is, why don't you delay the conversion to 3D NAND so that there's a lower bit growth in the market and let the market become even stronger before kind of adding more bits to the market? \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: D. Durcan, Type: Answer\n",
      "Monika, first of all, I would point out that the NAND market to us is really long term, very, very attractive. We see a lot of growth there, and we think it's worth investing in. Having said that, we believe that 3D is a key enabler to future leading-edge products and frankly, to long-term success in the business. And therefore, as we look at our business, we're prepared to invest in it. We haven't said a whole lot about what the rate of our ramp would be or exact timing as to when we would bring on additional supply, but we do believe it's important to get moving down the path of introducing our 3D products into the marketplace and enabling those end applications to use our products. Having said all of that, I think we've tried to be pretty clear that there is discipline in our approach, that we're going to look at the market on an ongoing basis and make sure that we don't disrupt supply, and that we think 3D is not something that is likely to be some sort of a step-function sea change in terms of how Micron or other competitors in the marketplace manage their production, and that's because there are trade-offs here. As you point out, there's capital investment required, there's clean room space. And it's not -- while it's enabling and important, it's not a massive disruption that we believe will create the oversupply you're alluding to. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: D. Durcan, Type: Answer\n",
      "Yes, I don't think that there's a lot we can add to what we've already said relative to Inotera. It's a 3-year agreement, as we said before. It's renewable on an annual basis. We value the relationship. We think the other parties value the relationship. And we think that, that sets the foundation for reasonable discussion that will lead to a long-term beneficial outcome for all parties. But trying to discuss in advance when and what that might look like, I don't think is particularly productive. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts: Mehdi Hosseini, Type: Question\n",
      "I have 2. On DRAM, can you please help me understand the mix between consumer PC, server and mobile and how this mix change, changing from November into the February quarter? And then on the NAND, it's great to give us an update on the milestones, but I'm still a little bit confused what the strategy is. Are you trying to be everything to everyone or are you trying to be more focused on the specialty segment of NAND that you are pursuing? Any color there will be appreciated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Answer\n",
      "So I'll start with the first question. As it relates to the share in the DRAM segment, best to think of our PC business, the PC DRAM business somewhere in the mid-30% share wise and our mobile DRAM business somewhere in the mid-20% and servers roughly high teens. And directionally, while these things are really tough to shift in 1 quarter, you see a mild uptick as we started to shift some more capacity over to server in Q1. Mobile was roughly flat, and the server business was -- the client business, PC business was maybe down little bit. But that's roughly how it shifted in the relative size of the share in DRAM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: D. Durcan, Type: Answer\n",
      "Yes, Doug, maybe I'll take that. As I mentioned, mix is an increasingly important piece of the answer in all these questions, because as we move to more value-added applications, that's going to drive different bit growth. Think about DDR4 to DDR -- DDR3 to DDR4, there's a 10% to 15% die size better [ph] moving to that technology, depending on exactly how you're positioned. That's going to mitigate bit growth in the year, but it's going to probably drive value. The customers certainly see a lot of value in getting the DDR4 today. Likewise, as we move to more differentiated products to service networking and high-performance computing and move more of our mix in that direction, we won't see the cost declines we've seen in the past, but hopefully, we'll see value add recognized by the customer. Beyond that, I would say there's not a lot structurally that would change here, other than you should recognize that Micron today is deploying capital to support a 20-nanometer ramp that is a large productivity step. And anytime you deploy capital, you don't get a return instantaneously. It takes a while for that capital to become installed and productive and for the line to be loaded and move through inventory and out in the marketplace. And so you have to contemplate that a little bit as 2015 is an exciting year for us in terms of technology deployment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts: Steven Fox, Type: Question\n",
      "Two questions for me, just to dig in a little bit more on the client SSD market. How much -- can you just sort of go into some color as to how much of the competitiveness you're seeing is temporary? And then from a Micron standpoint, how much gets kind of fixed as you roll out your TLC product or is there other things that you can do to improve margins there? And then secondly, if you could just sort of give us a little bit more of a color around the DDR4 timing of the ramp and how that's going to affect your mix and margins? Because I guess I was under the impression maybe it was going to move -- we were going to start to see it more in the quarter we're in now. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Answer\n",
      "So on the SSD side, we started to see kind of preholiday inventory build at the key customers, and we truly do believe it's a temporary piece of the market dynamics in NAND. What we have been seeing, as I said, over the last week or so, is that the NAND pricing actually stabilized a bit. In some segments, it's gone up. So relative to the question on TLC competitiveness, yes, as we bring those products to market, as I mentioned in my comments early in the second half of calendar year '15, we do expect to be able to compete more favorably, and we'll then be able to drive more of our mix to the TLC SSD client products. At this point, as we look at our opportunities there, we're just being careful not to try to compete with lower-cost products when we can take these MLC products and try to pursue better, higher-value homes. On the DDR ramp, as I said earlier, we're pleased with the ramp, albeit early. And we think it's reasonable to see by the end of our fiscal year somewhere in the area of 30% plus or minus of our server bits will be DDR4, and really the market -- we'll let the market dictate what that looks like as far as the ramp and the scale. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts: John Pitzer, Type: Question\n",
      "My first question is just kind of a follow-up on the bit production for DRAM. Can you quantify how much lower than the market you expect to grow this year? And I guess importantly, given the timing of product transitions, technology transitions, would you expect bit growth to resume sequentially from the February to the May quarter? \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: D. Durcan, Type: Answer\n",
      "Let me take the last bit of that John, and then maybe Mark can take the first part, Mark Adams can take the first part. Yes, I think we will see, as we move out in time, get back to sort of a more normal bit growth rate quarter-over-quarter. As I mentioned just a minute ago, when you deploy technology, sometimes there's disruptions in manufacturing. In particular, you want to make sure you're facilitating all the equipment to have legs out in the time and then as you deploy that technology, you don't necessarily get the bits and the output immediately. So yes, we would anticipate being back on a more normal trajectory further out in the year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts: John Pitzer, Type: Question\n",
      "By how much do you think you'll under-grow DRAM bit growth this year? You said you'd under-grow industry. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: D. Durcan, Type: Answer\n",
      "Oh, well, we didn't have a whole lot of position in that, but it kind of depends on the mix of DDR4 we put out into the marketplace and exactly how we progress with some of these specialty products I was talking about. We said sort of for the market in the low- to mid-20s, and we think we'll probably be 20% plus or minus, but a little bit below it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Answer\n",
      "Can I just make a comment on the front part when you talked about the product mix, John. Mind you, these things are not necessarily things that shift dramatically in a quarter, but to your point, you'll see mobile as a percent of our overall NAND business just quarter-over-quarter, almost double in terms of the share of the business, up close to 20 -- almost slightly 20%, slightly below 20% of our NAND business. And then you'll see a healthy shift away from our cars and component business as we do this and find better homes, and we'll continue to look at ways to drive enterprise storage and client SSDs for those markets that make sense. Mark made an interesting comment in his prepared statement today that we are finding customers that are not totally invested in TLC for their client SSDs where they're finding higher performance requirements or just simply reliability issues that they don't want to bet on in TLC. And so we're going to continue to drive our customers to evaluate our higher-performing MLC-based client SSD storage as we drive that forward as well. And so that should be the trend you see, mobile, a shift away from channel and driving more enterprise and high-performance client SSD. \n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts: Mark Newman, Type: Question\n",
      "The results on DRAM continue to do very, very well, continue to be much stronger than expected actually. And I think, if I could summarize what you're saying, we think that the market is going to be strong and tight, and that's going to continue throughout 2015. But looking at NAND obviously continues to disappoint, I think, with gross margins down and looks like you're projecting down again next quarter. So the question really I have for you, and some of it you've already talked about, but I want to ask more specifically, do you think this is -- this somewhat disappointment on the NAND side, I would say, or delay in the recovery, it seems to be, is it related to the market being worse than expected due to oversupply in the market or is it difficulties on execution? And what kind of timing should we expect for some improvement on the NAND side? It seems like the NAND recovery always seems to be about 2 quarters off. Obviously, TLC, SSDs, both have been mentioned as a big part of that solution. Now it seems like you're moving some of your mix to mobile, so I'd like to understand what the updated plan really is to improve the profitability of the NAND. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Answer\n",
      "Mark, this is Mark Adams. Thanks for the question. A couple of things. If you've looked back over the last couple of quarters, on a relative basis, our margins have held pretty stable relative to our competition, actually closing -- increment in closing the gap a little bit. Now we're not satisfied with that by any stretch, but those are some data points. This quarter, again, gross margin was pretty flat in a relatively tough period for NAND and the market dynamic. So as a backdrop to your question, that's what we're up against. When you talked about kind of a confusing or changing strategy, I don't think that's the case. Please don't mix TLC with where the end application products go. You had mentioned TLC and now a shift to mobile. Actually, mobile, enterprise and client SSDs were always part of our strategy and continue to be part of our strategy. TLC is the technology foundation for what will enable low-cost solutions in the market, and we're investing in that. Over the last year, both Mark and myself had made comments to the tune of sampling at the end of the calendar year. That's in place. We've done that. We're in process and starting qualifications. We said components and in consumer applications, we'd be shipping late spring, end of the calendar second quarter, and we'd be launching client-based SSD drives with TLC. Those are all tactics to the strategy of deploying TLC where it make sense in the market. That's not the whole story. Using our DRAM and NAND technology, the known good die flow from Elpida, combined with our technology in MLC and eventually TLC, we're going to launch and develop the mobile market. We're going to continue investing in controllers and firmware and software technology to advance both enterprise and client SSDs. We don't see TLC in the enterprise just yet. We'll continue to evaluate that path, but that's an end market. It has nothing to do with TLC or MLC. And on the client side, same thing, we're going to still make client MLC drives. But in markets that are looking for lower-cost alternatives and willing to sacrifice in performance, we'll deploy TLC. So those areas of mobile and enterprise and client storage are our 3 pillars of where we're investing to drive applications. And the technology, whether it be MLC or TLC, is the core to how we get there. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Answer\n",
      "I think the best way to look at it is, enterprise SSDs are likely to garner the highest margins, mobile would probably be second, and client SSDs, third of those 3. And then there still is -- healthy in terms of volume is the components channel out there for consumer applications and embedded applications and so on and so forth. So that can vary depending on the overall market dynamics. \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Answer\n",
      "Well, as we -- it's always tough to project. I would say, I want to caution you. The gut feel right now based on the feedback from our customers is that NAND is going to be relatively tight. Now when we talk about this changing business we're in, it doesn't mean that you won't have small periods, temporary periods where there's an oversupply in a certain segment of the market, whether it be a client SSD issue, whether it be something else. And so we think overall, with the growth in demand drivers in mobile, enterprise and client, that overall we think it's going to be in pretty good shape. And the type of demand forecast we're seeing from our customers suggests that things will remain in balance and be pretty positive in the remainder of our fiscal year. \n",

      "Analysts: Daniel Amir, Type: Question\n",
      "So I was wondering here, what has basically changed maybe from your perspective in the past 90 days? Is it more of the DRAM business or more of the NAND business? Because it certainly look like that 90 days ago there was more of a thought here that the NAND business might be in a change, demand remains pretty solid for DRAM. But now, you're looking at maybe lower bit growth here. So has something surprised you on the negative side or was this kind of the thought process 90 days ago on the business? \n",
      "\n",
      "Executives: Mark Adams, Type: Answer\n",
      "Sure. Thanks for the question. The way I would answer that is, we don't see any structural change in the business. On the NAND side, we do believe there was some shifting of some capacity from competitors into -- away from certain segments and into the kind of low-volume segments that hit pricing a little bit on the spot market in the client, entry-level client devices and what have you. But we don't see any structure there. We think actually, we're very bullish still on the NAND demand side of the business. And the DRAM piece, I think Mark spoke to the rationale behind what drove our decisions to making the DRAM capacity long-term decisions and investments. And so we still think it's a very good business, very stable and the ASPs are relatively flat, and we're still pretty positive. \n",

      "Greetings, and welcome to the Leggett & Platt Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Dave DeSonier, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. \n",
      "Good morning, and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's second quarter conference call. With me this morning are the following: Dave Haffner, our Board Chair and CEO; Karl Glassman, who is President and Chief Operating Officer; Matt Flanigan, our Executive VP and CFO; and Susan McCoy, our VP of  Investor Relations. The agenda for the call this morning is as follows: Dave Haffner will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release; Karl Glassman will provide segment highlights; Matt Flanigan will discuss financial details and address our outlook for 2015; and finally, the group will answer any questions that you have. Dennis Park, who is Senior VP of the company and President of the Commercial Products segment, is also joining us this morning to participate in the Q&A. This conference is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our expressed permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website. We posted to the IR portion of the website a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information along with segment details. Those slides supplement the information we discuss on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations. I need to remind you that remarks today concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the section in our 10-K entitled Forward-Looking Statements.\n",
      "I'll now turn the call over to Dave Haffner. \n",
      "Thank you, Dave. Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday, we reported record second quarter results from continuing operations, and I'm very pleased to have extended our string of strong quarterly results that began in the second quarter of last year. Sales increased 4% in the quarter. Higher unit volume and acquisitions added 9% to year-over-year sales growth. These gains were partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency translation impact, which, combined, reduced sales by 5%. We continue to benefit from the shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, new Adjustable Bed programs that ramped up last year and ongoing content gains and new program awards in Automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses experienced volume growth in the quarter versus strong prior year comparisons, with sales having grown 9% in the second quarter of last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations were also a second quarter record at $0.53 per share, up 10% from the $0.48 per share we earned in the second quarter of 2014. Earnings benefited primarily from higher unit volumes and pricing discipline, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.\n",
      "EBIT increased 17% and EBIT margin improved to 12%, up 130 basis points over second quarter last year. This was the highest quarterly margin that we've achieved in 15 years and reflects the improvements that we've made to our business portfolio and cost structure as well as the strong market positions of our current businesses.\n",
      "Since the recession in 2009, we've spoken about the earnings leverage from incremental volume produced utilizing excess capacity. With market share gains and higher market demand, our capacity utilization has increased. The margin improvement that we have realized over the past few years reflects, in part, that higher utilization. We still have available capacity to accommodate additional volume in many of our businesses, but there is less today than just a few quarters ago. In certain of our businesses and product lines, we have little to no capacity left, and we are investing meaningful capital dollars to support continued growth.\n",
      "In Automotive, we are expanding capacity to support new programs that will begin production in 2016 and later years. In bedding, we are investing rapidly in equipment that we build on our own Swiss operation to support the tremendous growth in Comfort Core, which we expect to continue for the next few years. In Adjustable Bed, which operated a single large location just a year ago, we are adding new locations to broaden our geographic scope and expect to be operating four facilities in North America by the end of this year. We are very pleased to be making these investments since they are directly associated with our expectation for continued meaningful growth in some of our strongest-performing businesses.\n",
      "We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that ended on December 31, 2014 [ph], we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 31% per year, which places us in the top 20% of the S&P 500.\n",
      "Now I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman. Karl? \n",
      "Thank you, Dave, and good morning. Most of our businesses continued to perform extremely well during the second quarter. In the Residential Furnishings segment, second quarter total sales increased 10%. Same-location sales increased 3% with 7% unit volume growth, partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency translation impact. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding acquisitions, deflation and currency, were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales increased 15%; innerspring unit volume grew 17%, with Comfort Core up 71% during the quarter; Boxspring unit volume increased 7%; International Spring sales grew 6%; furniture component sales increased 2%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper businesses up 6% and motion hardware unit volume up 2%. Sales also increased in Fabric Converting and Geo Components, while volume was down slightly in Carpet Cushion.\n",
      "Segment EBIT increased slightly in the quarter, but EBIT margin declined with a benefit from higher unit volume, largely offset by other factors, including increased performance-based compensation expense. EBIT margin also reflects the impact of higher adjustable bid passthrough sales and acquired facilities, both of which have lower-than-segment average margins.\n",
      "In the Commercial Products segment, second quarter total sales increased 28%. Same-location sales increased 18%, primarily from continued strong demand in Adjustable Bed. Unit volume in that business increased 81% during the quarter. Fashion Bed sales grew 12%, Work Furniture same-location sales decreased 5% in the second quarter, reflecting currency translation impact, lower volume in our Chinese operation and a less favorable product mix. Unit volume in North America was up slightly.\n",
      "In early March, we acquired a European private label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complementary to our North American private label operation that allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. This acquisition added 10% to the segment sales growth during the second quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the second quarter, primarily due to higher sales. As Dave mentioned, we are rapidly expanding production capacity in our Adjustable Bed business to support continued strong demand in that category.\n",
      "In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter sales decreased 9%, entirely from steel-related price reductions. Unit volumes were roughly flat, with growth in Drawn Wire, driven by strong bedding demand, offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill. A softer steel market and scheduled equipment upgrades at the rod mill resulted in fewer trade shipments, as was expected, versus the second quarter of last year. EBIT and EBIT margin increased significantly during the quarter, primarily due to cost reductions and pricing discipline.\n",
      "In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter sales were flat, with an approximate 5% volume improvement, offset by currency translation impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales increased 11%; Aerospace sales grew 10%; and Machinery sales were up 13% during the quarter. These sales gains were partially offset by very soft demand in CVP, with second quarter volume in that business down 20%, largely due to an industry change related to marketing programs for commercial vehicles.\n",
      "The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin grew slightly, with a benefit from higher volume, largely offset by increased performance-based compensation expense and several smaller factors.\n",
      "I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan, who will discuss some additional financial details along with our outlook for the full year. \n",
      "Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with our normal seasonality and our internal forecast, operating cash flow in the second quarter was $95 million, down slightly from the same quarter last year. For the 6 months of the year, operating cash flow increased $44 million or 52% to $127 million due to higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital, which was primarily related to accounts receivable. Adjusted working capital, as a percentage of sales, was 9.9% at the end of the second quarter. Excluding the foam litigation accruals, which are included in current liabilities, working capital was a more seasonally normal 11.6% of annualized sales.\n",
      "In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. 2015 marks our 44th consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $50.22, the current yield is 2.5%.\n",
      "We repurchased 1.2 million shares of our stock in the second quarter at an average price of $48.04 and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net-debt-to-net-capital at 36%, comfortably within our longstanding targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA, which is another typical financial metric. And at the end of the second quarter, debt was 1.9x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.\n",
      "For the full year 2015, we continue to expect strong unit volume growth and margin improvement, which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations. As we announced yesterday, we increased our guidance and now anticipate 2015 earnings from continuing operations of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our prior EPS range was $1.95 to $2.10. We also increased the low end of our prior sales guidance and now expect full year sales of $3.95 billion to $4.1 billion. This revised sales guidance represents a 4% to 8% increase over 2014 and includes an approximate 5% impact from raw material-related price deflation and currency translation. Based upon this guidance, we now anticipate a full year EBIT margin between 11.3% and 11.6%, which would be our highest EBIT margin level since the year 2000. We again expect operating cash flow to exceed $350 million in 2015. Dividends should require about $170 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $120 million for the year.\n",
      "As has been our practice, after funding dividends and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million and 5 million shares in 2015 and issue approximately 2.5 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and option exercises.\n",
      "With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner. \n",
      "Thanks, Matt. As I mentioned last quarter, we believe 2015 will be a very noteworthy year, and the second quarter results certainly support that belief. Our teams are finding ways to gain market share and content and improve efficiencies by critically controlling throughput, quality and cost. We're listening carefully to our customers and are dedicated to developing and manufacturing what they need, while delivering when and where they need it. We continue to be excited about the benefits our shareholders have recently experienced and those that lie ahead.\n",
      "Thanks to all for participating in our discussion today. And I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier. \n",
      "That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention, and we will be glad to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions] Jessie, we're ready to begin the Q&A.\n"
