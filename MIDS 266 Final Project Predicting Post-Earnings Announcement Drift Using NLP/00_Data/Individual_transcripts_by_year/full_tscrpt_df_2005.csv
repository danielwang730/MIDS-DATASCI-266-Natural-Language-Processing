My name is Janelle and I will be your audio coordinator for today. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Ms. Carin Fike. Please proceed, ma’am.
 
Thanks, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com.
Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Dillon.
 
Thanks, Carin and good morning, everyone. We are pleased you could join us to review Kroger’s first quarter financial results. With me today are Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s Vice-Chairman; Don McGeorge, Kroger’s President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer.
I’d like to begin this morning by briefly reviewing Kroger’s first quarter financial performance and then I’ll provide an update on Kroger’s outlook for 2006. Rodney will share additional details about our first quarter results and then we’ll be happy to take your questions.
Kroger’s associates continue to focus on delivering improved service, selection and value to our customers. This is translated into another quarter of impressive sales growth. Total sales for the first quarter increased 8.2% to $19.4 billion. This growth continues to be broad based across all divisions and all store departments. Growth was particularly strong in grocery, produce, natural food and fuel. Our convenience stores also had a very strong quarter not only in fuel, but in non-fuel merchandise as well. 
Identical supermarket sales increased 7.2% with fuel, and 5.6% without fuel. Once again, by either measure, this represents Kroger’s highest identical supermarket sales since the merger with Fred Meyer in 1999. It is also the 11th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales excluding fuel. We are extremely pleased by this performance and believe it compares very favorably to our traditional supermarket competition and indeed, just about every other retail competitor.
Net earnings were $306.4 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the first quarter. Net earnings in the year ago period were $294.3 million, or $0.40 per diluted share. Rodney will discuss two items that, together, affected our first quarter earnings by $0.05 per diluted share in the current year. After adjusting for these items, because they did not have a comparable impact on the prior year, you’ll see that Kroger had a very strong quarter. 
It was also another quarter that demonstrated the balance that Kroger’s strategic plan requires among several elements, including: sales, earnings, cost control and capital investment. We continue to believe this strategy is the appropriate path to build sustainable earnings growth and long term value for our shareholders. 
Turning now to some comments on 2006 guidance. You may recall that we originally forecasted identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel sales, in excess of 3.5% for fiscal 2006. Today we are raising our sales guidance. Kroger now expects identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel sales, to exceed 4% for the balance of the year; or approximately 4.5% for the full year.
This updated sales guidance reflects the momentum of our first quarter performance as well as opportunities we have identified for additional growth. It is tempered by the difficulty in forecasting additional sales growth in markets that experience unexpected increases as a result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita during the second half of 2005. Even so, the entire Kroger organization is still very focused on driving improvement in identical sales growth. As we’ve stated many times, sustainable, identical sales growth is a key driver of Kroger’s financial objective to increase earnings and generate value for our shareholders.
Kroger’s original guidance for earnings per share growth in 2006 of 6% to 8% did not contemplate the need to increase legal reserves. Based on first quarter results, the Company’s guidance for earnings per share growth for 2006 remains at 6% to 8%, including the increases in legal reserves. Absent the need to increase these reserves, Kroger’s projected earnings per share growth rate would be 9% to 11% for fiscal 2006. 
Now I’ll ask Rodney to share some additional details concerning Kroger’s first quarter results. 
 
Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, Kroger reported first quarter net earnings of $306.4 million, or $0.42 per diluted share. These results include a couple of items that are not comparable to our results in the prior year. As we indicated in our guidance for 2006, we began to recognize stock option expense in the first quarter in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This action reduced earnings by $0.02 per diluted share. 
As a reminder, our earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2006 included stock option expense of $0.05 to $0.06 per diluted share. We now expect the full year effect for fiscal 2006 will be $0.06 per diluted share from recognizing the stock option expense.
Also, based on developments during the quarter, Kroger increased its reserves associated with legal proceedings arising from hiring practices at its Ralph’s subsidiary during the 2003 and 2004 labor disputes. The current quarter charge reduced earnings by $0.03 per diluted share and increased the amount established for this contingency.
Our reserve represents our best estimate of the Company’s exposure in connection with these legal proceedings. As this is a pending legal matter, we will not comment further on this subject. When it’s appropriate to comment, we will. 
As Dave mentioned earlier, after adjusting for the two items I just discussed, we believe Kroger had a very strong quarter. Our financial performance in the first quarter reflects the consistent approach we have taken to managing our business and consistent with the plan we have shared with you. 
We continue to balance investments in gross margin and improved customer service with operating cost reductions to provide a better shopping experience for our customers. Our strategy directly affects Kroger’s gross margin, OG&A rate and operating margin. I’ll discuss all three in the context of our first quarter results. Let’s begin with gross margin.
FIFO gross margin was 24.55% of sales, a decrease of 61 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2005. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margins declined 9 basis points from the prior year. Kroger’s first quarter selling gross margin on non-fuel sales declined 33 basis points. 
As a reminder, selling gross margin is a term we use internally at Kroger to describe the Company’s gross margin before incurring expenses directly related to distributing and merchandising the products on our store shelves. These expenses include advertising, warehousing, transportation and shrink.
Selling gross margin is a measure of how competitively we are pricing the products we sell. Delivering value to our customers is one component of our overall strategy to improve the shopping experience. In the first quarter we were able to use improvements in shrink, advertising and warehousing expenses to help fund these additional investments and lower prices for our customers. 
OG&A declined 19 basis points to 18.17% of sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, the increase in legal reserves and the stock option expense, OG&A declined 16 basis points. Leverage from strong identical sales plus good cost control in such areas of energy usage and labor productivity helped us overcome some of the significant increases in fuel and energy related costs that many companies are facing. 
Excluding our retail fuel operations, we estimate that higher energy prices negatively affected gross margin by 30 basis points and OG&A by 4 basis points for a total negative effect of 7 basis points. This compares favorably to the 13 basis point negative effect in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Next, I would like to make a few comments about our operating margin for the first quarter. Kroger’s operating margin on a GAAP basis declined 12 basis points to 3.32% of sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel sales, an increase in legal reserves and stock option expense, operating margin grew 32% basis points. 24 basis points came from better sales leverage over rent and depreciation expense. The gross margin and OG&A effects I just discussed explain the remainder of the improvement. 
In keeping with our strategic plan, Kroger will continue to invest savings generated from reduced cost and improved productivity to enhance our customer shopping experience through better service, product selection and value. On a quarter-by-quarter basis, however, our operating margin may fluctuate depending on the timing of both our savings and our reinvestment in our customer shopping experience. 
For fiscal 2006 we still forecast slightly improving operating margins, resulting primarily from improvements at Ralph’s. During the first quarter we saw improvements in sales and profitability at Ralph’s and expect continual improvement. This will be one of the drivers of our earnings per share growth in 2006. 
Kroger’s financial triple play strategy supports the successful execution of our customer first business strategy. During the first quarter, strong cash flow enabled Kroger to invest in our high quality asset base, reduce debt and return value to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. 
Capital investments totaled $449.9 million in the first quarter compared to $400.6 million a year ago. We are on track to invest approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion in capital projects during fiscal year 2006 and we still anticipate total supermarket square footage growth of 1.5% to 2% before acquisitions and operational closings. 
For the first quarter, total supermarket square footage grew 1.6%, year-over-year, excluding acquisitions and operational closings. Our return on asset measures improved almost 1% on a pre-tax basis. This indication gives us confidence that we are investing our capital prudently. 
During the quarter, Kroger opened, expanded, relocated or acquired 16 supermarkets. We completed 39 remodels and closed 36 locations. Of these locations, 31 were operational closings. 16 of these stores were located in northern California, whereas we previously announced we are exiting the San Francisco and Sacramento markets under the Cala Foods Bell Markets and Ralph’s banner. 
Net total debt was $6.6 billion, a reduction of $829.3 million from a year ago, and a reduction of $2.1 billion since January 2000. Net total debt includes a reduction of $526 million to reflect temporary cash investments. Total debt was $7.2 billion, a reduction of $318 million from a year ago.
As you know, our investment grade rating is very important to us. We have steadily improved our coverage ratios in recent years, and our net total debt/EBITDA ratio in the first quarter was 1.98, the lowest since our recapitalization in 1988. Fitch Ratings recently reaffirmed our credit rating at BBB, and upgraded our outlook to stable from negative. 
During the first quarter, Kroger repurchased approximately 6.7 million shares of stock at an average price of $19.90, for a total investment of $133.5 million. Last month, we announced our Board's authorization of a new $500 million stock repurchase program, reflecting the Board's confidence in the company's strategic plan and our belief that Kroger shares represent an attractive investment. At the end of the first quarter, there are approximately $486.9 million remaining under that new authorization.
Since January 2000, Kroger has invested $3.1 billion to repurchase 162.4 million shares, or 18% of the outstanding shares, at an average price of $19.17. Kroger expects to buy back stock in 2006, in accordance with the company's financial strategy of using one-third of free cash flow for debt reduction, and two-thirds for share repurchase and cash dividend payments.
In March, Kroger announced that its Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy, and declared the payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.065 per share. Subsequently, on June 1st, Kroger paid a cash dividend to shareholders, the first such payment since our leveraged recapitalization some 18 years ago.
In addition to the financial triple play, Kroger's first quarter cash flow permitted us to make a cash contribution of $150 million to company-sponsored pension plans. This contribution completes our expected funding for fiscal 2006. Kroger's cash contribution in the year ago quarter was $88.6 million for the first quarter, and $300 million for the entire year. 
Our first quarter tax rate was 37.4%, compared to 35.9% for the prior year. The current quarter rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to state taxes. The first quarter of 2006 rate is higher than the prior year rate because, in 2005, we reduced previously recorded tax contingency allowances, resulting from a revision in the required allowances. We expect that our tax rate for fiscal 2006 will be 37.5%, consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year.
Now for some brief comments on labor. While we do not face the same magnitude of contract negotiations this year compared to last year, labor negotiations continue to be a challenge in the face of competitive pressures and rising pension and health-care cost. In each contract negotiation, we will work toward an agreement that meets our objectives for cost reductions or containment, while fulfilling our commitment to provide our associates with solid wages and benefits. This balance will allow Kroger to invest in our business to create new job opportunities for our existing associates and hire more people.
Now I will turn it back to Dave for some closing remarks.
 
We are very pleased with Kroger's first quarter results. This quarter gives us a solid start in fiscal 2006 towards achieving or exceeding the objectives we outlined for investors at the beginning of the year. In fact, we have already raised our identical sales and, from an operating standpoint, earnings-per-share guidance for the year to reflect our confidence in Kroger's strategic plan. We believe that Kroger's strong identical sales are primarily a result of our entire organization's effort to connect better with each and every customer, and to improve their overall shopping experience. 
We are going about that in several different ways, and it's more than just lower prices. Yes, customers tell us they want value, but they also tell us that there are other aspects of their shopping experience that are very important, most notably customer service and product selection. We are making strides in several areas that our customers notice every day, including shorter wait times at check-out lanes, full shelves with items our customers want, and improvements in the cleanliness of our stores. In each of these areas, we have seen double-digit percent improvements in our tracking measurements. 
We are pleased with the progress we are making, but there is still a lot of work to do. Our results this quarter and in the future can be tied directly to the contributions of our 290,000 associates. We appreciate their hard work and thank them for making strides in several key areas. This is a very competitive industry, and customers have a lot of choices, so we recognize that it is our associates who can and will make all the difference.
We'll now be happy to take your questions.

1|1622232.0|2005-08-31 12:30:00|Tiffany & Co.|3406|"Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Tiffany & Company second quarter earnings release conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. Participating on today’s call is the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Aaron, and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jim Fernandez.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir. 
 
Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on this conference call. We reported Tiffany’s second quarter results earlier today and hopefully you have had a chance to review the press release. 
Before continuing, please note Tiffany’s Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany’s 2005 report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now we can proceed. 
In the second quarter, Tiffany’s net sales increased 9% and we achieved solid sales growth in a number of markets. As we expected, a lower gross margin and higher expense ratio affected results. However, we said on our first quarter conference call that we expected virtually no pre-tax earnings growth in the second quarter and the results we issued today met that expectation. 
Also in the past few months, we opened stores in exciting U.S. and international markets, we announced plans for some others, and we introduced a number of new products. The Board of Directors increased the dividend  for the fourth consecutive year, and we again repurchased a considerable amount of stock. 
Let’s first look at our sales performance by channel of distribution in the second quarter. 
U.S. retail sales rose 8% in the quarter, primarily due to 5% comparable store sales growth, as well as results from several new stores. The 5% comp store sales growth was on top of a 6% increase in last year’s second quarter. In terms of the monthly trend during the quarter, comps rose 6% in May, increased 8% in June, and declined 1% in July. In last year’s second quarter, comps had increased 7% in May, 6% in June, and 4% in July. 
We are not going to read too much into the volatility of the monthly numbers and will not speculate on what future sales conditions it may portend. In fact, U.S. comps have rebounded in the month of August to date, with a mid-single-digit increase. 
After reporting disappointing results in the first quarter, sales in our flagship New York store rebounded in the second quarter with a 5% increase, which was on top of a 3% increase a year ago. We are looking forward to completing the renovation of the flagship store’s main floor, which has likely been somewhat disruptive to sales in the past six months, but which should be wrapped up next week. 
Comps in our seven New York suburban stores also rose 5% in the quarter. Sales results in our U.S. branch stores improved in the quarter with a 4% comp increase, which was on top of a 6% increase a year ago. 
Looking around the country, several regions with above average growth included our eight stores in Florida, our four stores in Texas and one in Denver, as well as the Northwest region, which includes our two stores in Washington, one in Portland and five stores in northern California. 
However, the six stores in our Pacific region, that includes Hawaii and Guam, were again soft, primarily due to a decline in sales to Japanese tourists. 
In terms of some sales dynamics, the 5% comp in the quarter was generated by an increase in the average spending per transaction, while store traffic and transactions were virtually equal to the prior year. 
In terms of price stratification, there was sales growth in every price strata that we measure. However, there was smaller percentage growth in sales under $500, but meaningfully higher growth in sales and transactions over $10,000, $20,000, and $50,000, which of course are at a lower gross margin. 
In terms of customer mix, the overall U.S. comp store sales growth in the quarter was due to higher sales to local market customers, which also accounted for the majority of the New York flagship store’s increase. 
Our expectation calls for a mid-single-digit increase in comparable U.S. store sales for the full year. Last year, U.S. comps rose 7% in the third quarter, 5% in the fourth quarter, and 7% for the full year. 
Consistent with our growth strategy, our U.S. plans include opening five new stores in 2006. We are getting strong results from our new store in Indianapolis that we opened in the second quarter. Also during the quarter, we expanded Tiffany’s presence in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California, when we added an 800 square foot diamond salon in our store there. South Coast Plaza is our highest volume U.S. branch store and the salon showcases Tiffany’s extraordinary diamond assortment and enables us to better serve the large and growing customer base. 
Earlier this month, we had a terrific opening in Nashville when customers welcomed our new store there. We also enjoyed a strong opening in our new store on the pier in Atlantic City, a new luxury retail project, and we are on track to open stores on the big island of Hawaii and in Tucson later this year. 
While U.S. comps rose 5% in the quarter, total U.S. retail sales rose 8%, indicating that new Tiffany & Co. stores continue to generate considerable sales and enthusiastic customer reaction. 
Staying in the U.S. for a moment, our direct marketing sales also rebounded strongly in the second quarter, posting an 18% increase. This was on top of a 5% increase last year and was better than our expectation. 
We said on the first quarter call that direct marketing sales at the end of April were soft because Mother’s Day occurred a week later than last year, which caused a shift in ordering and sales to early in the second quarter. These results are indicative of that shift. 
The strong direct marketing sales growth was generated by increases in both the number of orders and in the average amount spent per order. We are very pleased with the pace of e-commerce growth, as well as the customer’s favorable reaction to the product news we began selectively e-mailing to customers earlier this year. As we have said previously, we are reducing catalogue circulation by 10% to 15% this year due to the synergies between our website and catalogue. 
Let’s now turn to international retail sales, which increased 10% in dollars in the second quarter. 
On a constant exchange rate basis, which excludes the translation effect from foreign currency changes, international sales rose 12%, indicating the foreign currencies were generally weaker than the U.S. dollar versus a year ago. For example, in the second quarter, the Yen averaged 114 to the dollar versus 109 a year ago. My following comments by region will reference sales on that constant exchange rate basis. 
International comparable store sales increased 10% in the second quarter, which was on top of the 3% increase a year ago. Japan now represents approximately half of Tiffany’s international sales. Total retail sales in Japan increased 6% in the quarter, due to an increase in average jewelry price and mix. Comparable store sales from Japan rose 2% in the quarter, which was below our expectation and compared with a 1% increase a year ago. 
In terms of the monthly results during the quarter, comps increased 4% in May, on top of a 5% decline in May last year, rose 6% in June on top of a 2% increase, and declined 4% in July, compared with a 5% increase in July 2005. As noted in today’s press release, comps in August to date have posted a high single-digit decline. 
Geographically, the 2% comp increase in the second quarter was comprised of similar increases in Tokyo and outside Tokyo. The Ginza flagship store, rose 1%. 
We opened two boutiques in Japan in the first quarter, in Mito and Yonago, and closed one in Tottori in the second quarter. We also recently announced plans to open a freestanding store in November in the important Roppongi Hills section of Tokyo, which is a key centre of luxury retail activity. 
We are continuing to pursue attractive opportunities to expand and enhance Tiffany’s distribution base in Japan. Two current examples: 

We will soon complete a remerchandising of our Ginza flagship store and will highlight the change with a special bridal event, and the introduction of the Tiffany Novo Collection, a new brilliant cushion cut solitaire diamond ring. Building on our successful engagement jewelry business, Tiffany Novo will be exclusive to the Ginza flagship store in September and then rollout to the rest of Japan in October, followed by other international markets and the U.S. in early 2007;
A complete renovation of Tiffany’s boutique in Mitsukoshi’s Ginza store will be completed in September, as part of Mitsukoshi’s overall renovation of that important store. We expect sales results to benefit from these initiatives.

Let’s now look at the other half of the international retail channel, which is generating strong growth in sales and profitability. Comparable store sales in the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan increased 27% in the second quarter, which was on top of the 6% increase in the second quarter last year, and was considerably above our expectation. We experienced exceptional growth in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Australia. We are also seeing strong growth in China in percentage terms, but it is still on a very small base. 
We opened a second store in Beijing during the quarter, and later this year will further expand Tiffany’s presence in China with a second store in Shanghai and one in Macau. In addition, last week we opened a store in Busan, Korea to replace an older one that closed earlier this year. 
In Europe, comparable store sales rose 17% in the second quarter, which was on top of a 5% increase last year and was also above our expectations. We achieved strong sales growth in every European market. Sales in London rose nicely in the quarter, although sales were lower in the flagship store on Old Bond Street due to the disruption from the major renovation. However, we completed that renovation in mid-July and since then have seen a pronounced sales pick-up at that location. With almost 50% more gross square footage, the newly renovated store provides a more spacious and luxurious environment for our customers, and we are delighted with the results. We will further expand Tiffany’s European presence in September when we open a store in Vienna. 
Finally, turning to the other Americas, we achieved solid sales increases in our stores in Toronto, Mexico, and Brazil during the quarter. Our new store in Monterey has had a strong start and we are very excited about our plan to open a store in Vancouver this November. 
Looking at international sales for the rest of the year, we are looking for a  low single-digit increase in Japan comparable store sales for the full year, and for translation purposes are planning the Yen at 115 to the dollar. We are looking for healthy low double-digit comp store sales growth in the various other international markets outside Japan, but are not planning them at the robust rate seen in the first-half of the year. 
Finishing the top-line review, sales in our other channel rose 4% in the second quarter. Sales at Little Switzerland stores increased 10%. In addition, we are continuing with our development of Iridesse stores, where we are adding seven stores this year. 
There was actually a slight decline in wholesale diamond sales in the quarter, but we still expect the pace of such sales to accelerate in the remainder of the year based on increased rough diamond purchasing. 
That covers sales by channel of distribution. 
Looking at a few merchandising highlights in the second quarter, growth was seen across a range of product categories, with diamond jewelry maintaining a prominent role in the sales growth, from high-end diamond jewelry to diamond engagement rings, to new diamond and platinum pendants. We are also pleased with continued favorable response to some of Tiffany’s other relatively new fine jewelry collections, such as the Swing and Legacy collections. 
Our celebration rings initiatives continue to be very successful and has become an important base of our business. 
There was also growth in silver and gold jewelry, highlighted by the popular 1837 and Atlas collections. 
Sales also rose in the designer jewelry category, including Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso. 
We are pleased to report that the sales performance of Frank Gehry’s jewelry designs, even though only introduced into one-third of our stores at the end of the second quarter, is far exceeding our expectations, and we will complete the store rollout in the third quarter. 
Lastly, the timepiece and tableware categories posted modest sales growth in the quarter. 
I am now pleased to turn the call over to Jim. 
 
Thanks, Mark. Now let’s look at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin of 55.1% in the second quarter was four-tenths of a point below a year ago, which was close to our expectation. The decline largely reflected higher product costs. We recorded a LIFO charge of $8.1 million in the quarter, compared with a charge of $3 million in last year’s second quarter. 
We’d been affected by higher costs for precious metals, but as appropriate, are addressing cost pressures through retail price adjustments. Higher costs are affecting the entire industry, and while it is difficult to quantify any customer resistance to higher prices, we believe that Tiffany is maintaining its competitive position and value propositions. 
We continue to expect that gross margin for the full year will be approximately equal to the prior year, based on our assumption for sales mix, product costs, and anticipated wholesale diamond sales. 
SG&A expenses increased 12% in the second quarter, which was in line with our expectation. The year-over-year rate of growth accelerated in the second quarter, largely due to higher store-related costs. SG&A in the first-half has also included increased marketing related event spending tied to the launch of the Frank Gehry jewelry collection. 
As expected, the expense ratio of 42.5% in the quarter was higher than the prior year because of insufficient sales leverage on these and other SG&A costs. 
We continue to expect a high single-digit percentage increase in SG&A for the full year which, based on our assumption for sales growth, would still result in some improvement in the expense ratio for the full year. 
Other expenses net of $5.3 million in the second quarter were in line with our expectation, and we expect it to be approximately $20 million for the full year. 
Therefore, earnings before income taxes declined 4% in the second quarter and our expectation called for it to be approximately equal to the prior year. 
The effective tax rate of 38.9% in the quarter was higher than the 28% rate in last year’s second quarter. You will recall that Tiffany had a tax benefit of $6.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2005 related to the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 38% for the full year. 
Adding it all up, Tiffany generated net earnings of $41.1 million, or $0.29 per diluted share in the second quarter versus $50.6 million or $0.35 per diluted share a year ago. 
From a return perspective, at the end of the second quarter we were achieving a 9% return on average assets and a 14% return on average stockholder’s equity, which in both cases are close to our expectations. We remain committed to achieving appropriate and sustainable investment returns. Our long-term objectives continue to call for a 10% return on average assets and a 15% return on average stockholder’s equity. 
Tiffany’s balance sheet remains strong. At July 31st, net receivables were up 14% from a year ago, largely due to sales growth, and are turning at 19 times per year. Net inventories at July 31st were up 16% from a year ago. An increase in finished goods was partly to support sales growth, as well as for new stores and new products. There were also increases in raw material and work in process inventories due to higher diamond purchasing and the effect of higher metal prices. 
In total, our expectation continues to call for a mid- to high-single-digit percentage increase in inventories for the full year, and some improvement in inventory turnover. 
Tiffany was again very active in its share repurchase program in the second quarter, spending almost $84 million to buy 2.5 million shares at an average cost of $33.20 per share. In the first half of 2006, we spent almost $164 million on share repurchases. That alone would have left us with $113 million authorized for repurchases under a $400 million program expiring in March of 2007. However, as announced today in a separate press release, Tiffany’s Board of Directors has extended the program to December of 2009 and added $700 million to the authorization. That means we can spend up to $813 million in the next two-and-a-half years to repurchase stock which, at roughly current stock prices, would represent 15% to 20% of shares outstanding and market cap. 
We finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $147 million versus $129 million a year ago. Tiffany’s debt leverage remained reasonable at the end of the quarter, with total debt to stockholder’s equity at 33% versus 24% a year ago. 
We are optimistic about Tiffany’s prospects for 2006 and beyond. We certainly acknowledge that there are various economic uncertainties and geopolitical anxieties. However, we remain convinced that there are increasing numbers of discerning consumers seeking the extraordinary products that we offer. 
In existing markets, we communicate to customers with effective marketing and public relations initiatives. We also have the opportunity to expand Tiffany’s market penetration by entering many new markets. This year, we are increasing Tiffany’s worldwide square footage by approximately 7%, which is slightly above our mid-single-digit growth strategy. 
We will maintain our active product development program by introducing many new jewelry designs in a wide range of prices. 
I am pleased to say that Tiffany’s infrastructure is performing very well in support of our growth initiatives. Our internal manufacturing facilities are operating effectively, and our distribution centers are performing efficiently, handling store inventory replenishment and shipping Internet and catalogue orders to customers in a very timely fashion. 
We have substantial long-term opportunity to benefit from leveraging this highly developed infrastructure. 
Tiffany operates in a large and competitively fragmented industry, and we believe that our multi-channel communications and distribution represent a powerful model for long-term growth. 
In today’s press release, we noted that our expectation for this third quarter includes a mid-single-digit increase in earnings before income taxes and net earnings approximately equal to last year’s $0.16 per diluted share, which had benefited from a lower effective tax rate due to favorable reserve adjustments related to the expiration of certain statutory periods. 
Our full-year expectation for 2006 calls for low double-digit growth in earnings before income taxes, and net earnings of $1.77 to $1.82 per diluted share. Beyond 2006, our objective calls for at least 12% growth in earnings per share. 
We appreciate your interest in Tiffany. Please note on your calendars that we plan to report third quarter results on November 29th. That concludes this conference call, but as always, please feel free to call Mark with your questions or comments, and thanks for listening.

2|1897504.0|2005-10-26 12:00:00|Sprint Corporation|7014|"Good morning may I have your attention.  I'd like to thank everyone for holding and welcome you to this morning's Sprint Earnings Conference with our moderator Kurt Fawkes.  I need to remind everyone that today's conference is being recorded for play back purposes and we will take questions at the end of the conference.  Sir, at this time I'll turn the conference over to you and thank for calling the conference center.
 
All right, thank you Tim.  Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on our inaugural earnings call for Sprint Nextel.  The format of the call today, our President, CEO, Gary Foresee is going to kick off the discussion and then Paul Saleh our CFO will review our corporate performance including key balance sheet items and cash flows.  Following Paul's remarks, our COO, Len Lauer will update you on the integration process and discuss the wireless and long distance businesses.  Dan Hesse, the President of our Local Phone Division is going to close out our prepared remarks with a discussion of local business unit performance and an update on our local spin.  We're going to finish the call with Q & A.  And for our Q & A, Tim Kelly, the President of our Consumer Business will be joining us, Mike Fuller the COO of Local, and Mark Angelino, President of our Business Group.
Now I want to turn to Slide 2 and point out in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.  We provide a detailed discussion of various risk factors in our SEC filings and I strongly encourage you to thoroughly review our filings.  Throughout our call this morning, we will be referring to several non-GAAP metrics, Slide 3 contains reconciliation’s of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the third quarter.
Our earnings release also includes many of these reconciliations and can be found on our website.  Second quarter reconciliations of Long Distance and Local non-GAAP financial measures are available in our second quarter earnings release.  On Slide 4 we provide reconciliation between GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share.  Our third quarter GAAP results reflect the August 12th merger of Nextel and the August 12th acquisition of U.S. Unwired.  For the quarter, we reported GAAP earnings per share of $0.23, and our adjusted earnings per share was $0.29.  The major reconciling items include after tax charges of $51 million for hurricane-related items, $153 million in after-tax for after tax charges for merger and integration costs.  $25 million for an asset impairment, and these were offset by an after tax investment gain of $90 million.
On Slide 5, we show the reconciliations between reported and adjusted earnings for our proforma results for the third quarter and proforma will be the main focus of our discussions this morning.  Our proforma results assume the Sprint Nextel merger occurred at the beginning of each of the quarters presented.  For our proforma results, we have continued to reflect U.S. Unwired as of its acquisition date because it did not have a material impact on prior periods.  And to give you a flavor, U.S. Unwired added $32 million of revenue and $15 million of operating losses to our consolidated results in the third quarter.
Again, on a proforma basis, we adjust earnings for merger and integration costs, the hurricane-related items, and the asset impairment offset by the one-time gain.  Our proforma results include customer based quarterly amortization expense of $815 million.  This item was partially offset by lower depreciation expense following the adjustment of the Nextel property, plant and equipment balance.  I would also point out that our proforma results reflect an approximate incremental cost of $90 million per quarter that arises from expensing stock options on the Nextel side.  This item diluted our proforma Wireless EBITDA margin by approximately 120 basis points in the third quarter.
Finally, beginning this quarter, Sprint Nextel will report our Local and North Supply business units as a single segment, reflecting the fact that North Operations will be included in the Local business when it is spun off.  In our release, we have provided historical results reflecting this combination, and we have also continued to provide reporting on the Local business on a stand-alone basis.  And Dan's comments this morning will be focused primarily on stand-alone Local results.  Now I'm pleased to turn it over to Gary Forsee. Gary.
 
Thank you, Kurt and good morning everybody.  I want to add my thanks to you for participating in our call this morning.  I know that you're in the midst of a very busy week and I hope you'll find that you made a good investment of your time being with us today.  This call is another important milestone for Sprint Nextel and it adds to a growing list of achievements since we announced our merger last December.  I won't go through the list with you now but suffice to say, we have clearly covered a lot of ground in a very short period of time.  And from my experience, we are significantly ahead of schedule on all merger initiatives and the results that we are producing.
While I'm pleased with our achievements to date, less than a hundred days since we closed our merger, I recognize it's only the top of the first inning, and there's considerable work ahead of us.  Today's initial results, however demonstrate the winning potential that we hold for our employees, and customers, and for our owners.  For our employees, Sprint Nextel provides a great place to work.  The breadth and depth of our operations in telecom is unmatched and our employees recognize that this also means a wide range of opportunities to build outstanding careers.  Since the merger, our internal employee server data shows a growing level of job satisfaction and I expect that momentum will continue to build as we make progress on multiple fronts in the coming months.  For customers, Sprint Nextel provides the opportunity to do business with a Company that has an unmatched portfolio of services and mix of assets to support their needs.  From individual consumer, to the small business owner, to global enterprise, uses of our service will see us deliver the promise of yes, you can.  Sprint Nextel opened up for business with a rock solid balance sheet and strong investment grade credit rating.  We delivered annualized proforma revenues of nearly $45 billion in the quarter, that grew at a 8% level versus last year.  Our proforma adjusted OIBDA for the quarter of $3.7 billion grew at 10% and adjusted earnings per share prior to purchase accounting effects is up 32% on a year-over-year basis.
So far investors, Sprint Nextel provides the opportunity to own a company with a strong financial foundation and superior growth profile.  It allows investors to own a piece of a wireless business that now serves more than 45 million subscribers and is producing rapid top line and bottom line growth.  And investment in Sprint Nextel also allows investors to own interest in a global long distance backbone that serves nearly all the Fortune 1000, delivers far superior top line performance relative to it's peers, and is producing substantial free cash flow.  It also provides the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a soon to be independent local telephone business that consistently has delivered solid financial results and strong cash production.
Finally, the owners in our Company will have the opportunity to share the rewards afforded by the substantial synergies we will produce as a result of the merger.  Last month we announced 20% increase to our synergy target to 14.5 billion on net present value basis.  You will recall this target after we twice raised our collective plan capital spending on our networks by a total of nearly $4 billion over the next three years.  There are a number of initiatives already under way that will help us achieve these synergies and we feel very comfortable with this revised target.
These synergies span every category of the P&L from revenues to real estate costs, and touch just about every function in the business.  And we're off to a fast start, I might add.  For example, by consolidating executive teams, we have reduced 25% of the Senior Management positions that existed in our two stand alone Companies.  Our new brand was launched and is rapidly gaining traction in the marketplace.  The merger of our sales teams has provided a seamless transition for our enterprise customers. And these are just a few examples to provide a flavor of the type of Company that we are becoming.  Of course it will take a consistent sharp focus on execution and attention to detail to fully realize these opportunities.  I believe the track record of this management team along with our early results as a combined Company should give you comfort that we will do just that, continuing our track record of doing what we say we will do and delivering those results.
We do have some unfinished business to attend to, and that is defining our future relationship with the Sprint PCS affiliates and Nextel partners.  As you know, we made progress in this area with the acquisition of U.S. Unwired, Gulf Coast Wireless and IWO already completed.  We continue to hold discussions with the remaining affiliates on various alternatives but have not crossed the finish line on additional transactions.  With respect to Nextel partners Monday showing a vote to put the Company to Sprint Nextel has set us on a very well defined path.  The next step this that process is for Sprint Nextel to select it's appraiser over the next 18 days and we will certainly keep you informed of our progress on these fronts.  I do want to tip my hat to our people who continue to work tirelessly to ensure we provide customers with the most innovative services and the best customer service experience possible.  The level of effort has been extraordinary, particularly when you add in the likes of Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and the level of effort that is underway as we plan the spin of our Local Company.  So thank you to our Sprint Nextel associates.
Finally, I want to close my remarks with a commitment to you that as a new Company, we will continue the legacy that both of our companies built over the years and being very transparent with you in our communications.  I hope you find the extensive proforma information we're providing this morning is helpful in assessing our prospects and you should take our detailed reporting this quarter as a good indication of the aspirations we hold in this area.  Now I'll turn the call over to Paul.
 
Thank you, Gary and good morning everyone.  I'm pleased to be with you today to share our prospective on our initial results as a combined Company.  I want to begin by echoing Gary's comment on the strong performance of Sprint Nextel.  In the quarter, we reported strong revenues, earnings and cash flows in each of our segments.  Our execution to date has been note worthy in the face of closing our merger, launching our new brand and I integrating our businesses.  It reflects the ability of our management team to meld together and hit the ground running.
Turning to the proforma financial information on Slide 9, third quarter net operating revenues were $11.2 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year and 2% sequentially.  Consolidated adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion, up 46% compared with the third quarter of last year.  The year-over-year increase was due to an increasing contribution from Wireless, stronger result at Local and lower depreciation in our Long Distance business.  Sequentially, adjusted operating income was essentially flat.  Consolidated adjusted or OIBDA for this quarter was $3.7 billion, 10% higher than one year ago, and up slightly on a sequential basis.  Proforma adjusted EPS was $0.25 per share in the third quarter or 56% greater than the prior year and 9% greater on a sequential basis.
On the purchase price accounting, we recorded an asset on our balance sheet of approximately $10 billion, associated with the value of our iDEN customer base.  This asset is being amortized over five years and represents incremental quarterly amortization expense and purchase accounting effects of $0.16 per share on an after-tax basis.  Excluding these items, EPS would have been $0.41.  Total proforma capital investments during the third quarter were $1.5 billion with nearly 80% going to our Wireless operations.  Year-to-date proforma capital investments were $4.9 billion both of these figures exclude rebanding costs.
On Slide 10, I'll summarize our business mix.  As you can see from the slide, Sprint Nextel is well represented in the growth areas of the telecom.  In the third quarter, over 70% of Sprint Nextel's revenues and profits were derived from the Wireless segment.  Excluding Local, Wireless would have contributed 83% of the Company's revenues and 90% of its adjusted OIBDA.
Now we'll turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our financial position.  Our total asset at the end of the quarter were $101 billion, and shareholders equity was $52 billion.  Cash and marketable securities total $8.9 billion and growth debt at the end of the third quarter was $25.3 billion.  Our strong cash position gives us the flexibility to ultimately resolve the Nextel Partners process as determined by the appraisers.  We are also prepared to address potential outcomes from our ongoing discussions with the Sprint PCS affiliates.  In the interim, we do not expect to use cash to reduce our debt balances.  By doing this, we are preserving our flexibility to apply the proceeds of the debt issuance associated with the Local spinoff in a tax-effective manner.
Overall, we expect to maintain a strong financial position consistent with an investment grade rating.  And anticipate that the Company will continue to generate solid free cash flow from operations.  We will soon have the opportunity to consider distributing excess cash to shareholders in the form of share buy backs and dividends.  However, at this time, we are limited in our ability to plan such distributions by certain restrictions under the tax code that apply to our expected Local spinoff.  Accordingly, we will not jeopardize the tax-free nature of the spin and we will review our cash distribution policy with our Board at the appropriate time in the near future.
I'd like to turn to Slide 12 now to briefly review our merger-related synergies.  As we shared with you recently, we expect to deliver $14.5 billion of merger synergies, which include $1.6 billion from revenue opportunities, $3.7 billion from reduced capital spending, and $10.2 billion from lower operating expenses.  We also expect to spend $1.5 billion on integration costs.  Year-to-date, we've incurred $608 million in merger and integration costs with the majority flowing through the income statement and a fortune recorded as part of purchase accounting related to the merger.  As we have previously stated, we're confident in our ability to achieve our targeted synergies.  We're off to a good start.  We have a robust program in place to track our progress and ensure that these synergies are realized.  These synergies will enable Sprint Nextel to achieve an adjusted OIBDA service margin, excluding the local phone business of 40% or more by 2008 or earlier.
Slide 13 covers our new guidance for the full year.  On a proforma basis we expect full year consolidated revenues to be approximately $44 billion or 8% higher than in 2004.  Wireless is expected to generate full year revenues of approximately $32 billion, an increase of 12% to 13% year-over-year.  In the fourth quarter, we expect approximately $1.4 million total direct net ads with strong sequential growth in both direct PostPaid and prepaid net ads.  Full year, Long Distance revenues are expected to be approximately $6.9 billion or about 6% lower than in the prior year.  Local revenues are expected to be around $6.5 billion for the full year or slightly ahead of full-year 2004.  We expect full year consolidated adjusted OIBDA to be up 9% to approximately $14 billion.  We expect full year capital spending to be around $6.4 billion, excluding rebanding costs.  Wireless capital is expected to be $5 billion before rebanding while Long Distance is targeted at $350 million, and Local is expected to be between $850 million and $900 million.
Lastly, I'll update you on our tax position.  Sprint Nextel's book tax rate should be approximately 38% on a go-forward basis.  However, given our NOL position, our cash tax rate is expected to be around 10% to 15% on a pre-tax book income through 2006.  Now I'll turn the call over to Len.
 
Thanks, Paul.  And good morning everyone.  I'm pleased to be with you this morning to report on our progress.  I know there's been a lot of speculation about just how well we are doing so I hope our remarks today will be helpful in answering your questions.  After the close of our merger on August 12th, we immediately began to execute on the detailed plans that had been drawn up for combining the two Companies.  We've listed some of our major activities on Slide 15 and I want to begin my remarks this morning with a few comments on these.  In area staffing, Sprint Nextel has named over 90% of the managers of the new Company and in many organizations we are complete to the individual contributor level.  We expect the naming of the remainder of the organization will be largely completed in the fourth quarter.
On distribution, at the beginning September, we initiated our market launch, 100% of our Company's retail stores and kiosks were stocked with new promotional materials and 90% were selling both CDMA and iDEN products.  We expect to have completed exterior signage change out in the majority of our stores by year-end and in all of our stores in the February time frame.  In the indirect sales channel, we have equipped more than 60% of the agents with both CDMA and iDEN equipment and sales materials.  All together, we have more than 30,000 points of distribution selling both product lines and our sales teams have completed over one million man-hours of sales and customer care training.  Sprint Nextel has already completed four important sourcing projects in the area of the supply chain, including the selection of our vendor for 411 directory services, which will generate savings of $65 million or more on an NPV basis which is greater than our expectations.  Overall, we have launched 60 sourcing initiatives, which are designed to leverage our scale and deliver substantial operating and capital synergies.
One example of these initiatives is our billing platform.  In the past two months, we have issued the RFT and began the evaluation of the supplier responses for integrated customer care and billing platform.  In Customer Service, our careful planning and customer communications has resulted in incremental call volumes being less than anticipation.  In the short term, we continue to have separate care operations for CDMA and iDEN customers but w have implemented a smart call routing capability which gets our customers to the appropriate service reps.  First-call resolution statistics are meeting or exceeding pre-merger levels.  We have more work to do to increase overall Customer Service levels but we're off to a good start.
In our new branding campaign, we're excited about the merits of our exciting new brand which we've been advertising which features more communication choices and flexibility for enterprise and government customers, as well as our consumers.  Our differentiated campaign emphasizes action, capability, and the experience of our new Company.  On week four of our ad campaign, Sprint Nextel reported a 36% brand recall for advertising versus 31% for our nearest national wireless competitor.  Initial data also indicates we achieved a modest gain in our share of wireless decisions during the month of September.
Now let me turn to our operating performance, and on Slide 16, I want to get into our proforma quarterly performance.  Amidst all the integration activities, our Wireless business added approximately 1.3 million new subscribers in the quarter and our total subscriber base increased by 19% versus last year to 45.6 million.  During the third quarter, Sprint Nextel added a little over 1.1 million Post Pay Direct subscribers, including the acquisition of 454,000 PostPaid subscribers from U.S. Unwired.  We also added 68,000 Prepaid subscribers with this acquisition.  In our Direct Prepaid business, Boost Mobile delivered a terrific quarter with 300,000 net subscriber additions.  The favorable Boost subscriber trends are being aided by the strong appeal of the Boost Lifestyle brand, improved handset selection, enhanced distribution, and more competitive pricing for internet interconnect services.
PostPaid Direct gross additions were $2.9 million for the quarter, virtually the same as the second quarter and 4% lower when compared to one year ago.  Gross Ad productivity for the quarter increased slightly in our business channels, and decreased in our consumer channels, largely due to limited advertising in July and August as we kept our powder dry for the new brand launch on September 1st.  We did infact experience improving consumer sales trends during September, and this momentum has continued in October.
In the quarter, total Wireless revenues grew 12% compared to the year ago period due to a larger base.  In the quarter, service revenues were up 11%, equipment revenues of $817 million were up 8%.  And wholesale affiliate revenues of $227 million were up 37% versus one year ago.  In the quarter, we delivered a 14% improvement in adjusted OIBDA, and a 45% increase in adjusted operating income.  The adjusted Wireless OIBDA margin in the quarter was 36.6% of service and wholesale and affiliate revenues.  This margin was 35.7% a year ago and 37% in the second quarter of this year.  During the quarter, the cost of services and products increased 15% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to nearly $3 billion.  These increases were driven by increasing network costs from restoring service to the hurricane damaged areas, from the elimination of tower collocation credits following the second quarter modernization of our tower assets, from the general expansion of the network and also from incremental back call costs for EVDO sites.  In addition, the cost associated with our Service and Repair business increased in the quarter and we had higher costs associated with our Handset Upgrade Program, which will help loyalty for our customer base.
Selling, General and Administrative expenses were 31% of revenues during the third quarter.  This ratio was on par with the second quarter and was down slightly from one year ago.  In the quarter, bad debt expense was 2.1% of revenues versus 1.2% in the second quarter.  This increase is due to a higher consumer mix on the iDEN platform.  We currently expect bad debt expense to be around a similar level in the fourth quarter.  The increase in bad debt expense was offset by lower IT and customer care costs.
Now I'd like to turn to Slide 17 to drill into some of our key metrics for the quarter.  Turn on the Direct PostPaid base was 2.1% an improvement over the 2.2% from one year ago, but an increase in the second quarter turn rate of 1.9%.  In the quarter, involuntary turn rose while voluntary turn declined versus the second quarter.  The CDMA subscriber base reported record low voluntary turn, in part due to the strong adoption of our Fair and Flexible Service Plan.  Increases in involuntary turn, however, rose for iDEN customers due to the growth of our iDEN consumer base.  The turn rate for Boost Prepaid this quarter was 4.9%, a solid sequential improvement.
Third quarter Wireless ARPU for PostPaid customers was $65.  Sequentially lower by $1, with about $0.34 of this decline resulting from higher customer credits as a result of hurricane Katrina.  We also saw lower overage charges sequentially.  On the year-over-year basis, proforma ARPU was $2 lower, mainly due to lower overage charges, the increased customer hurricane credits, and modestly lower monthly access fee, which were offset by increased contributions from Data Services.  In the quarter, the average PostPaid usage was slightly over 16 hours per month, which was consistent with the second quarter, and up just under 10% from the year ago period.  Our Boost Prepaid Service continues to deliver strong ARPU of $37 per subscriber.  This compares to the second quarter of ARPU of $38 and is mainly due to a lower contribution from interconnect services.  For Direct PostPaid subscribers, Data ARPU was approximately $5.25 per subscriber or 40% higher than one year ago.  We continue to experience strong customer demand for PCS Vision, Blackberries and our industry data solutions and we had solid sequential gains in Data ARPU on both the CDMA and iDEN platforms.  Since the third first quarter of 2005, we have been selling EVDO connection cards to business accounts and I'm pleased to report that sales and service levels are trending up nicely.
Our capital investments continue to be focused on increasing capacity in signal density, expanding coverage, and deploying 3G Data Services.  On Slide 18 you will see the third quarter proforma capital spending was $1.3 billion, which includes rebanding expenses.  In the quarter, our networks managed 107 billion minutes of use, up 2% sequentially and 22% versus one year ago.  We added a thousand new sites during the quarter, bringing our total wireless sites in use to 47,000.  During the quarter, approximately $89 million in capital was spent on our rebanding activities, bringing the year-to-date total to $282 million.  We anticipate that these expenditures will be applied against our rebanding obligations.  These expenditures include new iDEN equipment and site modifications, which will be needed when certain 800 megahertz channels are returned to the SEC in 2006.  A small portion of rebanding spend is for new equipment necessary to relocate broadcast auxiliary licenses from 1.9 gigahertz to 2.1 gigahertz.
Now let me turn to Slide 19 to give you a sneak peek of our product plans.  Suffice it to say that our third quarter was devoted to careful integration of our Companies to deliver in preparations for a high growth, highly profitable communications and entertainment business.  With the new brand taking root, an increasingly experienced sales staff and exciting new products and services including, a very broad selection of EV-DO handsets with multimedia capabilities which we'll be bringing to our stores very soon.
Expect an announcement very soon regarding Sprint's music store, which will feature a strong array of content and choice for downloading, listening to, and managing songs while on the go.  Impressive new iDEN handsets, such as the i930 Windows Smartphone, and the 7100i, a Blackberry device in a thinner form factor, and innovative new services, such as our exclusive NFL content, GPS assisted location services, Sirius Satellite Radio Channels and a number of new services designed to take advantage of the speed of our high speed EVDO network delivering exceptional visual clarity and sound quality.  And also a hosted Blackberry solution for small businesses.  We are on track with our previously announced EVDO deployment plans and you should expect to hear more about our exciting new services in the near future.  As a reminder, by year-end, Sprint Nextel plans to offer high-speed wireless data services to 130 million people.  Increasing to over 150 million people by early 2006.
Let me now move to our Long Distance results, our third quarter performance for Long distance business, you will see on Slide 20.  I'm pleased to report that we had another quarter of improving top line performance.  This trend is being driven by demand for our differentiated MPLS services and our volume increases in our wholesale voice business due to growth in cable telephony and wireless backbone demand.  On the MPLS side of the business, we recorded several new account wins including the Federal Aviation Administration and Northern Trust.  Strength in these areas is offset by decline in our Consumer Voice and Legacy Data business.  Our year-over-year revenue comparisons continue to be impacted by our exit for the Dial IP business and the Hosting business.  Together, these two categories accounted for roughly 35% of the year-over-year decline in total revenues at Long Distance.
Business Voice revenue increased by 2% from the third quarter of 2004 and 3% sequentially due to strength in the wholesale and affiliate voice services.  Our Cable Network Operator business continues to do well.  We are on track to meet our guidance of at least a hundred million dollars in revenue in 2005.  At the end of the third quarter, we surpassed 600,000 cable voice subscribers.  Consumer Voice revenue was steady in the third quarter on a sequential basis but was 27% lower versus one year ago, due to reduced volume and rate declines.  This is merely a continuation of recent trends as more traffic goes wireless.  Consumer Long Distance Voice revenue is now less than 10% of total Long Distance revenue and 1% of the Company's consolidated revenues.  This compares very favorably to our industry peers.  Revenue from Data Services declined at recent historical rates down 4% for the quarter and down 6% on a year-over-year basis caused by lower frame relay broadband and ATM revenues.  These declines were partially offset by higher revenues from our Managed Network Services.
The Company's Internet revenues were approximately 6% higher sequentially, and 4% higher than one year ago.  The annual increase of Internet revenues are somewhat massed by the effects of exiting the Dial IP business.  As customers migrate from ATM and frame relay to more efficient MPLS networks, our dedicated IP business grew 6% sequentially and 20% year-over-year.  Our market advantage is in our multi-tasking capability.  The ability to run Voice Data and video through the same platform and our scalable class of services offered.  We are very pleased with customer demand for MPLS services in the quarter and we expect this trend to continue as customers realize substantial operating efficiencies available from this service.  The Long Distance business delivered solid profitability for the third quarter.  Adjusted OIBDA for the third quarter was $285 billion.  This was a 8% sequential increase, but a 6% decline from the same period last year.  In the quarter, the adjusted OIBDA margin was 16.4%, which compares favorably to second quarter margin of 15.3% but is slightly down from the 16.7% margin, which we reported one year ago.  Lower gross margins and higher advertising expenses in the quarter were offset by savings from general cost controls and reduced bad debt expense.
Finally, we continue a selective investments in the growth area of our Long Distance business and maintain our industry leading position in our appropriate return on the capital deployed.  We have increased our guidance slightly for full year LD CapEx, and this reflects growing demand for MPLS Services, Cable Voice Services, and replacing CapEx from hurricane damage.  In the quarter, Long Distance capital expenditures was $83 million.  Adjusted OIBDA exceeded capital expenditures by over $200 million for the quarter.  On a year-to-date basis OIBDA is running approximately $590 million ahead of our capital adjustments.  Now we'll turn to Slide 21 for an update on update on Local and I'm pleased to hand it off to Dan Hesse.  Dan.
 
Thanks Len and good morning, everyone.  To many of you in the investment community I've worked with before, and to those I haven't, I look forward to having a strong and open relationship with you going forward.  I've been here for four and a half months and for two quarterly results releases, and this quarter is no exception to the string of strong quarters you have come to expect from Sprint's Local division.  I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Mike Fuller and the outstanding team he's assembled to lead the new Local Company, which is what we call ourselves internally until we choose a new name.  Before talking about the third quarter, I'd like to make a few comments.  Even though I'm pleased with our performance, we will have to be a much more effective competitor in the future if we intend to grow.  With business customers, we are now holding our own.  We're with standing what Cluck and cable competition have to offer.  The separation from Sprint Nextel should give us the opportunity to improve here by allowing us to focus business sales resources more intentionally on our local markets and products and apply those resources more effectively against small and SOHO businesses what some call down market.  Our wholesale businesses customers continue to perform well, and we intend to be the facilities-based carrier of choice in our territories.
The consumer market's going to be more challenging.  Revenue and excess line losses are accelerating as cable voice competition and wireless substitution become larger factors in the marketplace.  In addition to doing a better job of retaining our current customers, we plan to be more aggressive and proactive in increasing new line orders, for example, reaching out to people moving into or within our territories and winning back customers from competition.  We intend to build more direct and indirect channels to go to market with.  We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to create a new name, a new image, and a new brand next year and we do not intend to squander it.  We're working hard to bring new offers and capabilities to the market next year that will set us apart.  This will not be simple, as in this short time frame, our team must also deliver strong results and simultaneously separate from Sprint Nextel, which, in itself, is a very resource intensive and complex endeavor.
We expect to be a fortune 350 New York Stock Exchange listed Company and our plans to launch this new Company in the second quarter are on track.  By the way, I'll conclude my remarks with a more detailed discussion of our planning efforts in this regard.  Our people are energized by our plans and the prospects of creating this new Local Company and I look forward to aggressively attacking our challenges with them.
I'd like to now turn to Slide 23, talk about our performance.  I'm pleased to report that Local had a strong quarter with solid revenue, operating profit and cash contribution performance.  Sequential revenue performance was supported by another quarter of strong growth in Data.  Continued effective expense management allowed us to achieve an adjusted OIBDA margin of 50%.  We also continued to prudently manage capital expenditures.  In the period, our adjusted OIBDA exceeded CapEx by $533 million, an increase of 16% compared to the third quarter of 2004.  In the quarter, as with the previous several quarters, we achieved solid results from our growth initiatives, including DSL and bundles.  In the quarter, we added 48,000 DSL subscribers, while maintaining solid pricing levels.
Turning now to our financials on Slide 24, total local revenue of $1.5 billion was flat compared to the third quarter of 2004 and was up 1% sequentially.  Voice revenue declined 2% year-over-year and was flat sequentially.  This year-over-year decline is primarily due to fewer access lines and lower access minutes of use.  In addition, recall the 2004 voice revenue was negatively impacted by a $14 million FCC ruling associated with an inner state price cap dispute.  Data revenue increased 17% from last year and 5% sequentially.  Fueled by DSL gains as well as special access sales, primarily to wireless carriers.  Looking at revenue by customer segment, consumer revenue was down 1% year-over-year, but was flat sequentially.  Business revenue, including wholesale was up 1% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially.  Third quarter adjusted operating income of $464 million was up 5% year-over-year, driven by reduced costs, as well as the 2004 price cap issue mentioned previously.  On a more apples-to-apples basis, without the price cap effect of last year or any hurricane costs in either year, operating income would have been up $6 million or 1.3% over last year.  Sequentially, adjusted operating income was down 1% due to seasonally higher expenses.
Compared to the year ago to the year ago period, third quarter adjusted OIBDA increased by 4% but declined by 1% sequentially.  Capital expenditures were $209 million, for the quarter, or 14% of revenues versus $257 million or 17% of revenues for the same quarter of last year.  Compared to a year ago, total voice access lines and service declined by 280,000 or 3.6%.  During this same time frame, DSL lines increased by 206,000 or 48%.  Residential retail voice lines declined by 241,000 or 4.5% to $5.1 million, driven mainly by wireless substitution of primary lines and broadband substitution, including our own DSL of second lines.  In the quarter, business retail access lines declined by 30,000 or 1.4% to 2.1 million.  This compared to a 1.8% decline in the second quarter.  Wholesale lines declined by 4% to 214,000.  In the quarter, net switched-access minutes were down 10% year-over-year.
I'll now move to North Supply.  For the quarter, revenue was $274 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year and 38% sequentially.  These significant improvements were due to strong growth in nonaffiliated sales, primarily to Bell South.  North Supply entered into a new agreement with them in early July and it quickly ramped in part due to the hurricanes damage in their territories.  This contract and several others are expected to be strong contributors to North Supply's top line results in 2006.  North Supply produced break even adjusted OIBDA compared with the modest gain in the third quarter last year and modest loss last quarter.
Turning to Slide 25, I'd like to address the competitive environment that we're operating in.  Overall, we continue to see our primary competition coming from Wireless.  However, cable telephony competition is increasing.  For this discussion I'll focus on cable.  We estimate that cable broadband services are available to about 80% of our existing primary line customers.  We estimate that cable telephony services are now available to about 30% of our existing primary line customers and our estimate is this could grow to about 40% by the end of the year.  Last quarter we said we believed we lost a total of 50,000 primary access lines to cable, since early 2004.  We believe this aggregate number now stands at approximately 70,000.
Overall, the twin forces of wireless substitution and cable telephony are expected to exert rolling pressure on our Voice business and we now believe that full year rate of decline in 2005 will be around 4%.  As cable telephony coverage increases, we expect residential access line losses to accelerate.
Let's now go to Slide 26.  In the quarter, the contribution from Data Services to Local's overall results continue to expand.  Total Data revenue grew by 17% to over $215 million in the quarter or $1 billion annualized.  Annualized DSL revenue is now $350 million and represents 6% of total quarterly revenue.  Special access revenue grew by 7% year-over-year driven primarily by wireless carrier demand.  In the quarter we saw a continuation of the trend of strong Data growth driven by DSL and special access, which offset Voice declines.
Turning to Slide 27, as I promised you earlier, I'm going to conclude my remarks with an update on the separation of the Local business into a strong independent Company.  We have completed the filings in the 14 of our 18 states in which we operate that require approval for separation.  We are pleased with how our proposal has been received by the state regulators and we now expect the separation to be complete sometime in the second quarter of next year.  We have made significant progress on establishing key transitional and commercial business relationships with Sprint Nextel and we expect to finalize these relationships by the end of the fourth quarter.  We're also working hard on the required SEC filings.
The Executive Team for the new Local Company's in place and we're in the process of naming the other positions.  We have put significant energy into building a new organization, including bringing the business sales resources back into the Local Company and planning for the staffing of our corporate functions.  And we continue to believe that we will be able to operate with a manageable level of incremental costs associated with being an independent public Company.  Our plan is to be effectively operating as an independent Company early in the first quarter of 2006.  This period, before the separation, will be a valuable opportunity to work out any kinks.  We will concentrate on separating from Sprint Nextel and building our new Company, plus implementing innovative new capabilities to aggressively attack our competitors, all while we continue to focus on delivering strong operating results.  Now I'll hand the call over to Kurt for Q&A.

I'd like to inform all participants that this call is being recorded at the request of Dell.  This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Inc.  Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without prior written permission of Dell, Inc. is prohibited.  As a reminder, Dell is also simulcasting this presentation with slides at www.dell.com/investor.  Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  
I'd like to turn the call over to Miss Lynn A. Tyson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications.  Ms. Tyson, you may begin.
 
Thank you.  With me today are Chairman, Michael Dell; CEO, Kevin Rollins; and CFO, Jim Schneider.  Jim will review the third quarter results as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter.  Kevin will follow with his perspective on the market and our strategy and then we'll take your questions.  I'd like to remind you again that we've posted our presentation on our website at Dell.com/investor to accompany this call.  We encourage you to read this deck for additional financial and operating results as well as a reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results.
Before we begin, I want to just give you an update on our Ion program for the balance of this fiscal year.  We will continue our conference call series with executive management on January 9, with Joe Marengi, our Senior Vice President of Americas and Gary Kopshaught, our Head Services for Americas.  They'll discuss our services strategy as well as our customer engagement strategy.
Finally, we want to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events including our fourth-quarter outlook discussion are forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations.  Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties which are discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement contained in our press release and on our website.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim.

 
Thanks, Lynn.  While we are disappointed we didn't reach our revenue target for the quarter. We are very pleased with our ability to deliver industry-leading profitability, consistent growth in earnings, and a balanced P&L.  In the third quarter, revenue was up 11% as record earnings grew 18% on a non-GAAP basis.  We delivered over 1.1 billion in cash flow from operations and invested over $1.4 billion to repurchase our stock.
Operational highlights include, Revenue outside the U.S. was up 20% year-over-year.  Enhanced services revenue grew 36% year over year to $1.2 billion.  In the Enterprise storage revenue was up 35% and server units were up 21% year-over-year.  And software and peripherals revenue grew 25% year over year to 2.1 billion.
Turning to our results for the third quarter, we generated 13.9 billion in revenue, an increase of 11% year-over-year.  GAAP EPS of $0.25 includes nonrecurring charges totaling 442 million, or $0.14 per share.  As we mentioned in our October 31, press release, over $300 million of the charge is associated with the cost of servicing systems that included vendor part which failed to perform to our specifications.  The remainder is related to workforce realignment and other actions designed to reduce complexity and provide greater efficiencies.  Excluding these charges, EPS was $0.39 on a non-GAAP basis.  For the remainder of the call, all references to our financial results will be non-GAAP, excluding the above-mentioned adjustments.
Our third-quarter operating margins came in at 8.6%.  Operating expenses of 10% reflect increased investment in customer experience and seasonal investments in sales capacity in advance of the holiday-selling season.
Cash flows from operation for the quarter was 1.1 billion with free cash flow of over $1 billion.  You should also note that beginning this quarter, we have also included a table in our web deck that reconciles cash flow from operations to our free cash flow.
Our cash conversion cycle was a negative 36 days and we ended the quarter with 12.3 billion in cash and investments.  As I mentioned, we spent 1.4 billion to repurchase about 41 million shares.  And year to date we have repurchased roughly 140 million shares which is more than three times the numbers of options we expect to grant for the full year.
Looking at our products and services, we delivered growth in key strategic segments, including servers, storage, services, and the important shift to mobility.  In the enterprise we continue to expand our storage footprint with revenue up 35% year-over-year and our server revenue grew 16% year-over-year.
In the quarter, we are the first to market with our portfolio of single, dual, and four socket power head servers and precision workstations with Intel's new multicore Intel Xeon technology.  This multicore solution delivers the largest generational performance gain ever seen in the most widely supported architecture in the world delivering 50% greater performance, while maintaining a common systems image for both single and multicore systems.  To complement this multicore technology, we also unveiled the comprehensive database offering featuring the new Microsoft SQL server database so that customers can more effectively migrate their critical data with the complete database solution.
A good example of our model strength in bringing value, performance, and repeatability through standard-based computing and services is our recent agreement with TRW Automotive.  As part of this global three-year agreement, Dell will install and support 24,000 desktops, notebooks, and workstations along with hundreds of PowerEdge servers and Dell EMC storage systems.
In addition, Dell will provide assessment and design services to help TRW implement its storage area networks.  We continue to have great success in our high-performance computing clusters.  Recently Brigham Young University installed six new Dell supercomputing clusters containing a total of 682 PowerEdge rack and Blade servers.  And scientists at the University of Bonn recently upgraded to a Linux HPCC with 128 PowerEdge servers.
Our enhanced services revenue grew 36% year-over-year, to $1.2 billion, and the deferred revenues were up $200 million sequentially to 3.4 billion as our attach rate of extended services continues to grow.  In a recent survey of hundreds of corporate IT buyers by CLO Magazine, Dell was rated number one among leading vendors for providing impeccable customer service.  Also during the quarter, Dell’s superior value and quality was recognized with the star award, for service excellence in the category of mission critical support environments from the service and support professionals association.
In software and peripherals, revenue growth of 25% was driven by digital displays and imaging.  We continue to see strong growth in laser printers and overall consumables as we place a greater emphasis on higher value laser and all in one inkjet printers.  This mix shift helped to drive a 31% increase in total revenue, as consumables reached 46% of our Dell imaging revenue.  For the quarter, we believe, our U.S. inkjet share will be 20% with laser share at 13%.
We are pleased that our printers will soon be recognized by a major rating service that conducts independent surveys of customer satisfaction and product quality.  We also announced three new additions to our television lineup.  A 50-inch plasma HDTV, a 37-inch LCD, and a 32-inch LCD all incorporating our latest technology designed to develop sharper images and leading-edge functionality.
In the fast-growing mobility space, units were up 38%.  In the quarter, Dell became the first major computer supplier to announce multiple wireless carrier partnerships focused on integrated broadband capability.  Desktop PC revenue declined 2% year-over-year as a shift to mobility continued.  During the quarter, we refreshed our XPS line of high-performance computers with added performance, power, and style aimed at gamers and tech enthusiasts.  We launched the M140 and M170 notebooks and three new desktops.  All of our XPS products come with enhanced services and individualized support.
Turning to our regional performance, revenue outside the United States was up 20% year-over-year and was 40% of Dell's overall revenue.  In Europe, our revenue grew 19% year-over-year with revenue outside the U.K. growing 25%.  Our growth in the U.K. was slower than anticipated driven primarily by the public sector while France, Germany, and the UK home and small business segments continued to strong growth.  In Asia-Pacific in Japan, we delivered revenue growth of 20% year-over-year, led by 71% year-over-year growth in services and 53% growth in software and peripherals.  In China, units were up 46% year-over-year, with revenue up 29%.  In the Americas international, our model continues to excel with revenue up 22% year-over-year.  This growth is fueled by continued strength in Latin America, where mobility revenue was up over 30% year-over-year and server revenue was up over 20%.
In the United States, we gained share and remain the number one systems vendor in each of our segments.  In Americas business unit revenue grew 10% as overall demand remained healthy.  In the quarter we began shipping product from our third U.S. manufacturing facility located in North Carolina.  This 750,000 square-foot plant will build systems for customers in the eastern United States.  We also opened a new customer contact facility in Oklahoma City and expanded our small parts hub in Ohio which will speed the delivery of spare parts for field service.
The U.S. consumer business was challenging with revenue down 2% year-over-year.  In the quarter, we announced that we will consolidate our U.S. consumer business back into our Americas business unit.  This structure will allow us to drive additional efficiencies in our transactional businesses, and provide better value and services to our customers.
Before I turn it over to Kevin, let me touch on our fourth quarter.  As Lynn noted, these comments contain forward-looking statements.  For Q4 we are forecasting a revenue of 14.6 to 15.0 billion.  Up 9 to 11% year-over-year.  We expect margins in Q4 to contract modestly from Q3 driven by a seasonal increase in consumer and investments in our customer experience initiatives.
We expect investment and other income of about $60 million, a tax rate of 24.25% and at least $1.7 billion of share repurchase.  As a result, we expect EPS between $0.40 and $0.42, an increase of 8 to 13% year-over-year.  And as most of you know, we have an extra week in our fourth quarter.  Historically, this has had a minimal impact on our overall results.
Now, let me turn it over to Kevin for a more detailed discussion of our strategy.
 
Thanks, Jim.  There are three points, key points that I want to make.  First, our direct model is known for driving executional excellence and we are keenly focused on that for this quarter and for the future.  Second, our model is still cost advantaged at all price points and in all products which drives our focus to balanced growth, in and across price bands, the result is solid revenue and earnings growth.  Third, we are excited by a number of technology and product advancements coming in the next 12 months and will use our model to accelerate the accessibility of these advances to our customers through the Dell effect.
Let me expand on these points.  After the second quarter, we took a hard look at our execution and began making changes to balance our product and our pricing model.  In Q3 we took actions in three key areas.  We implemented improvements to increase efficiency and drive lower operating expenses.  We put processes in place to drive pricing consistency across customer segments.  And we focused our resources to improve customer support.  While we still have work to do, we are already seeing some results including the consolidation of the consumer in the small medium business sectors in the United States and the efficiencies that that brings.  The pending launch of Tech Connect which allows Dell agents to remotely connect to a consumers computer via broadband to solve their problems.  Third the acceleration of fiscal year '07 cost reduction initiatives, and lastly, the improvements in IT that are reducing complexity and improving our overall on-line capabilities.
Second category is our model in the how advantaged it is.  We have an advantage cost position at all price points, and we are driving a better balance now that optimizes profit while providing sustainable top-line growth across all price points.  We are focused on driving product and operating cost reductions, and we are reinvigorating growth in the premium space, while capturing market and profit share at all price points.  We do this with superior technology, sell it in strategic management strategies, the management of our component mix to ensure superior share growth and profits.  And you can see the results in our operating profit margin, which is from two to five times of that of every competitor.
Finally, the Dell model is optimized to bring the most relevant technology to our customers in the most efficient manner, and several trends look very promising over the next 12 months.  For example, in the Enterprise where our growth is unabated we'll be launching several new products in the first half of next year, including our ninth generation server product line, which will be refreshed and features dual core processors, fully buffered NIM memory with advanced memory buffering that give our customers superior computing performance at a performance per watt lead.  We'll be launching a new array of industry leading network storage products that will utilize new SATA technologies to improve price per gigabyte beyond the 70% declines we've already delivered.  This will be a first to the market.
And new Dell open managed systems management software that will further improve our server and our storage capabilities incorporating imaging and printing product management as well.  This combines nicely with an ongoing shift to data center applications to Linux and Windows and only Dell is positioned as a pure play enterprise vendor squarely focused on a scaleout strategy for the enterprise.
In the client space, the mix will shift to dual core mobile notebooks, and workstations with broadband wide and local area wireless.  As well as the launch of our enhanced XPS desktops reflects our traditional focus on high value for customers and better margins for Dell.  For example, our XPS line of high-performance workstations and notebooks grew at more than two times the growth of our mid tier and basic systems in Q3 and we expect that to continue.
Later next year, in the launch of Vista, for Microsoft, we'll provide a giant step forward in desktop and mobile computing functionality and we expect customers to begin configuring systems to effectively run Vista well in advance of the launch.
So with that, I'd like to open it up now for questions.  Operator.

5|2386930.0|2005-11-17 22:00:00|Autodesk, Inc.|2500|"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the third quarter 2007 Autodesk financial results conference call. My name is Sam, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions].
As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Sue Pirri, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
 
Thanks, operator. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today, as we report results for our third quarter of fiscal 2007. With me today are Carl Bass and Al Castino.
Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available via webcast on our website, ""www.autodesk.com/investor.""
During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of the Company, including our guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter and the fiscal years 2007 and 2008, the factors we use to estimate our guidance for those periods, our competitive position, our future business prospects and revenue growth, our market opportunities, and trends for our products in various geographies. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially.
Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, and specifically our 10-K for fiscal 2002, our 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30th 2006, and our periodic 8-K filings, including the 8-K filed with today's press release. These documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause the actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements.
In adherence to regulation Fair Disclosure, Autodesk will provide quarterly information and forward-looking guidance in its quarterly financial results press release and this publicly announced financial results conference call. We will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter, unless we do so in a public forum.
Autodesk does not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl Bass.
 
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today, Autodesk reported another quarter of very good financial performance. Quarterly revenue was a record $457 million, a 21% increase over last year.
Spending on total costs and expenses was in line with our projections in the quarter, increasing $10 million sequentially, before taking into account expenses resulting from the voluntary stock option review. And once again, we achieved record quarterly results on many of our most important business metrics, including 3D revenue, subscription revenue, and revenue from emerging economies.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that like many companies, Autodesk has undertaken a voluntary review of our past stock option granting practices. We will not provide the interim results of the review. Similarly, we will provide final earnings results, once the review is complete.
Now, let's talk about the quarter. Customer demand for Autodesk products was robust this quarter. Compared to last year, revenue from new seats increased 20%. Revenue from new seats of Revit and Civil 3D continued to be exceptional, increasing 94% and 44%, respectively, compared to last year.
Revenue from new seats of AutoCAD Mechanical and AutoCAD were also robust, increasing 57% and 24%, respectively, compared to last year. In addition, one of our emerging businesses showed particular strength this quarter. Revenue from Buzzsaw, our hosted collaboration service for the Building industry, increased 79% over last year.
Once again, sales from new seats and emerging businesses were approximately two-thirds of total revenue in the quarter. This continues to be an indicator of the underlying strength of our business.
Our 3D solutions, Inventor, Revit and Civil 3D, continued to gain market share, as customers across all industries recognize the benefits of adopting model-based design. Total 3D revenue increased 36% over the third quarter of last year to $98 million. We shipped more than 38,000 commercial seats of our 3D products.
Our Revit family of products had outstanding performance, again. Quarterly revenues increased 98% over last year, and we shipped 18,200 commercial seats. Civil 3D had terrific performance in the quarter, growing 57% over last year, and we shipped 6,900 commercial seats. Inventor revenue increased 12% compared to last year and 7% sequentially.
Japan continues to be a source of weakness for Inventor, where revenues again declined compared to last year. Inventor revenue increased 15% in EMEA and 26% in the Americas. In total, we shipped 13,000 commercial seats of Inventor in the quarter. We continue to win market share, as the boundaries erode between mainstream solutions, such as Inventor, and overpriced legacy offerings.
Our model-based 3D products already represent 22% of total revenue, and we are still in the early stages of penetrating our large installed base of 2D users as well as increasing our market share by converting users of competitive legacy systems. We estimate that approximately 10% of our growing 2D base has added 3D, leaving significant opportunity for future growth.
Emerging economies continue to be an area of very strong performance for us. Quarterly revenue in emerging economies increased 38% over last year and now represents 15% of total quarterly revenues.
Subscriptions showed terrific performance in the third quarter. Driven by strong attach and renewal rates, subscription revenue reached $111 million, an increase of 50% compared to the third quarter of last year. Subscriptions now represent 24% of total revenues. Deferred subscription revenue increased $12 million sequentially to $275 million.
Consistent with the large increase in subscriptions, upgrade revenue decreased in the quarter, as expected. Combined revenues from subscription and upgrades in the third quarter increased 17% over last year to $162 million, representing approximately one-third of total quarterly revenue.
Quarterly revenue from our Media and Entertainment segment grew 50% over last year. Our animation business grew 14% sequentially and nearly 160% over last year to $33 million. New versions of Max and Maya were launched at the end of the second quarter, and customer feedback on both products is terrific.
Revenues from 3ds Max increased 28% over last year. And Maya had its best quarter ever, increasing revenue 33% sequentially. As our results show, the integration of Alias is complete, and the animation business is soundly on track. We are looking forward to strong results in the future.
Advanced Systems revenue increased 5%, both sequentially and over last year. Our customers continue to transition away from proprietary high-end SGI workstations to Linux-based solutions running on standard PCs. Revenue from our Linux-based solutions was strong in the quarter. In fact, once again, more than 80% of systems product revenue was Linux-based this quarter.
While we don't believe this transition is complete, we are very encouraged by these results. Overall, I'm very pleased with our financial performance this quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Al for a review of our financials.
 
And thanks, Carl. Once again, Autodesk delivered great performance. As Carl said, net revenues in the quarter were $457 million, 21% higher than last year. Each of our geographies grew substantially compared to the third quarter of last year.
Revenue in the Americas was $194 million, an increase of 21%. EMEA revenues were $160 million, an increase of 20% as reported and 14% constant currency. And Asia Pacific increased 22% to $103 million. Revenues in Japan increased 3% compared to last year. Excluding Japan, revenues in Asia Pacific increased 36% compared to last year.
Looking at the divisions. Platform Technology revenue decreased 9% over the third quarter of last year to $197 million. Growth in PTDs was led by a 24% increase in AutoCAD new seat revenue and a 29% increase in AutoCAD subscription revenue.
As planned, upgrades of AutoCAD decreased 40% compared to last year. Revenue from AutoCAD LT was approximately flat with last year, due to weakness in Japan and the timing and type of promotional activity.
Manufacturing Solutions revenue was $85 million, an increase of 34% over last year. As Carl mentioned, AutoCAD Mechanical had a terrific quarter, increasing revenues 33% over last year. In total, we shipped more than 93,000 seats to our users in the manufacturing market.
Revenue for Building Solutions increased 28% over last year to $58 million. Revenues from Revit increased 98% compared to last year. Revenues from Architectural Desktop, our vertical solution for architects, were approximately flat compared to last year, as customers are increasingly moving to our Revit platform.
Infrastructure Solutions revenue increased 14% over last year to $50 million. As in the Building industry, strong adoption of our 3D products is impacting growth rates for our vertical 2D products. While revenues from Land Desktop decreased compared to last year, revenue from Civil 3D increased by 57%.
And as Carl mentioned, Media and Entertainment had a very strong quarter with revenue of $64 million, an increase of 50% over last year and 10% sequentially, driven by growth in our animation products, 3ds Max and Maya.
As we have said, because we're in the process of completing the stock option review, we will not provide EPS. However, we can tell you that our spending for total costs and expenses, which include cost of license and other revenue, cost of maintenance revenue, marketing and sales, research and development, and general and administrative, increased by $10 million sequentially as expected.
This increase does not take into account expenses resulting from the voluntary stock option review. This increase does include a $3-million write-down of Advanced Systems' inventory. As a result of this write-off, gross margins decreased 1 percentage point, both sequentially and compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2006.
In addition to the $10 million increase I just mentioned, we spent approximately $3.6 million on legal, tax and accounting fees related to the voluntary review of our stock option grant practices and paid a onetime bonus of $8.8 million to the non-executive employees who were enrolled in the employee stock purchase plan.
This bonus was approved by the Board to compensate for the benefits lost by non-executive employees, because Autodesk was legally precluded from issuing shares to the employee stock purchase plan due to the ongoing review.
Interest and other income increased by $3 million sequentially to $6 million, partially due to higher interest rates and increasing cash balances as well as reimbursement of an escrow amounts related to a prior acquisition.
Compared to last year, foreign currency impact was $6 million favorable on revenues and immaterial on expenses. Compared to the second quarter, foreign currency impact was $2 million favorable on revenue and $2 million unfavorable on expenses.
Total deferred revenues were $333 million, including $49 million classified as long-term. Deferred subscription revenues were $275 million, an increase of $12 million sequentially and $90 million over the third quarter of last year.
Total backlog, including deferred revenue, increased to $352 million. This included product backlog of $19 million. Channel inventory was slightly below our normal range of three to four weeks. DSO decreased 1 day from last quarter to 51 days.
Capital expenditures were $7 million in the quarter. Cash and investments increased $129 million sequentially to $597 million, because we were not able to repurchase shares during the quarter pending the resolution of the stock option review.
During the quarter, we received $10 million from employee stock plans. There were approximately 231 million total shares outstanding and 242 million fully diluted shares. We had a very strong third quarter. Now, I'll turn to guidance.
As usual, our guidance takes into account today's foreign exchange rates, including some level of buffer against future strengthening of the dollar. Because of our ongoing voluntary stock option review, I'm not going to provide EPS guidance.
Net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 are expected to be between $490 million and $500 million. We expect spending for total costs and expenses in the fourth quarter to be approximately flat with the third quarter.
Estimates of fourth quarter spending for total costs and expenses include approximately $5 million in legal, tax and accounting fees related to the voluntary stock option review and do not take into account other charges, if any, resulting from the voluntary stock option review.
For fiscal 2007, we are now expecting revenue in the range of $1.832 billion to $1.842 billion. Now, looking at fiscal 2008, based upon the best information that we have today, we are first providing preliminary guidance for the first quarter and full year.
For fiscal year 2008, net revenues are expected to be between $2.075 billion and $2.125 billion. Operating margins for the year are expected to increase 3 to 4 percentage points excluding expenses, if any, resulting from the voluntary stock option review.
Operating margins from fiscal 2008 are expected to increase 1 to 1.5 percentage points, not taking into account estimated FAS 123(R) stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, litigation accruals, legal tax and accounting fees, if any, and charges, if any, resulting from the voluntary stock option review.
Net revenues for the first quarter of 2008 are expected to be approximately flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Consistent with normal seasonal trends, we expect spending for total costs and expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to increase approximately $10 million sequentially.
Estimates of spending do not take into account legal, tax and accounting fees, if any, or any other charges, if any, resulting from the voluntary stock option review. Now, let me turn it back to Carl 
 
Thanks, Al. Before we take questions, I'd like to summarize a few key thoughts. Once again, Autodesk had very strong financial results. We continue to win share in all of our key markets. We achieved record results from many of our key metrics including 3D revenue and revenues from our subscription program.
The Americas and the emerging economies reported their best quarters ever, but the modest growth we saw in Japan was not up to our expectations and we continue to focus on improving our performance in this key economy. Adoption of our model based 3D solutions is increasing worldwide and growth in our 2D solutions remains robust. Remember that our strong 2D growth fuels our 3D opportunity. 
Excluding the cost of the voluntary stock option review, our profitability continues to exceed our expectations. We remain committed to optimizing revenue growth and profitability.
And finally, we remain very confident of our growth opportunities. While there are currently a number of mixed signals about the overall health of the economy, customer demand for our products remains very strong. The innovation and productivity enabled by Autodesk solution provide our customers with a real competitive advantage they need in every economy.
Operator, we're ready for questions.

6|1843320.0|2005-11-30 13:30:00|Tiffany & Co.|3013|"Good day, everyone and welcome to this Tiffany & Co. third quarter earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Aaron and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jim Fernandez. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. On this conference call, Jim and I will review Tiffany's third quarter performance and comment on the near-term outlook. Please first note the following Safe Harbor statement for Tiffany.
Statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2005 report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now we can proceed.
The results we reported this morning included solid comparable store sales growth in the U.S. and in many international markets. Our gross margin declined modestly. The SG&A expense ratio improved. We recorded gains in the quarter associated with the sales of equity investments. Our effective tax rate rose modestly from last year. So all in all, we reported 23% net earnings growth.
Let's first look at Tiffany's sales performance in the four channels of distribution. Total U.S. retail sales rose 9% in the third quarter. On a total U.S. store basis, this was due to an increase in price and mix as well as some increase in unit volume. Comparable store sales growth of 6% in the quarter was pretty much in line with our recent expectations and was on top of a 7% comp increase in last year's third quarter. While we saw an increased number of transactions on a total U.S. store basis, as well as higher spending per transaction, comparable store sales growth was driven entirely by higher spending per transaction.
Sales rose nicely throughout the quarter with comps increasing 6% in August, 7% in September, and 4% in October. For comparison, you should note that U.S. comps in last year 's third quarter had increased 5% in August and 8% in both September and October. From a geographical perspective, sales in the New York flagship store rose 13% on top of a 12% increase a year ago. We were pleased to finally complete the multi-year renovation of our New York flagship store during the quarter, and the reaction of our customers has been quite favorable. 
In addition, comps in the seven New York area branch stores rose 6%. Branch store comps around the U.S. rose 4% and there was no particular geographical concentration of strength. For example, a few stores with the largest percentage increases were in Seattle, Palm Desert, Houston, Coral Gables and Charlotte with varying degrees of change in other markets. However, the softest region was in the Pacific, where we continue to experience sales declines in Hawaii and Guam.
Our price stratification analysis for the U.S. indicated that the greatest growth occurred in sales and transactions over $20,000 and over $50,000 which as many of you know, occur at lower gross margins. 
In terms of customer mix, the majority of the comp store sales growth came from higher sales to local market customers, which was also true for the New York flagship store. 
Lastly, we are experiencing robust performance in the new U.S. stores we've opened in 2006 in Indianapolis, Nashville, Atlantic City and Tucson. We will wrap up our U.S. store expansion for the year when we open a beautiful store on the big island of Hawaii tomorrow. 
Also in the U.S, sales in the direct marketing channel rose 11% in the third quarter which was slightly above our expectations and was on top of a 4% increase last year. Growth was generated by increased numbers of orders and increases in the amount spent per order. As planned, we reduced catalogue circulation in the quarter in line with our full year objective to reduce mailings by 10% to 15%. On the other hand, we began e-mail marketing earlier this year to the large customer database we have accumulated in recent years and these communications serve as timely reminders of upcoming holidays while providing appropriate gift suggestions.
Let's now look at international retail sales which rose 9% in the third quarter but included some very divergent results. The 9% growth was on top of a 7% increase last year and was pretty much in line with our expectations. There was minimal currency translation effect in the quarter, and on a constant exchange rate basis which excludes the effect of translating local currency results into U.S. dollars, international retail sales also increased 9% in the quarter while comparable international store sales rose 4%. 
My following comments will refer to sales on a constant exchange rate basis. The international retail channel is composed of several distinct regions with approximately half of the channel sales in Japan while the other half includes the rest of Asia Pacific, Europe, Canada and Latin America. 
Total retail sales in Japan in the third quarter declined 3% as a decline in unit volume was only partly offset by an increase in average price and mix. Comp store sales in Japan declined 5%, which was below our expectation for a smaller decline and compared with a flat comp in last year's third quarter. The yen averaged 117 to the U.S. dollar in the third quarter versus 112 a year ago; therefore, the 3% decline in total Japan retail sales in yen translated into an 8% decline in U.S. dollars. Results in Japan were consistently soft throughout the quarter with comp declines of 5% in August, 4% in September and 7% in October. In comparison, comps in last year's third quarter had declined 2% in August and 1% in September, but had increased 4% in October. In the quarter, the 5% comp store sales decline was divided pretty evenly between the Tokyo market, including a 4% decline in our Tokyo flagship store, and locations outside Tokyo.
Recent economic reports confirm that the Japanese economy is growing, although it appears that the environment for consumer spending is challenging. However, we believe that Tiffany has the potential to improve its performance there as we continue to focus on a more proactive customer engaging sales approach, as well as upgrading a number of our retail locations in Japan through renovations, expansions and/or relocations. This year we've opened four locations and closed one in Japan, including the highly visible opening earlier this month of our freestanding store in the Roppongi Hills section of Tokyo.
Sales growth was notably better in the other half of international sales, continuing the strong trends from the first half of the year. In the Asia Pacific region outside Japan, a 17% increase in comparable store sales in the third quarter was above our expectations and was on top of a 4% increase last year with notable strength in Hong Kong and Australia. We're also pleased with Tiffany's growing presence in China, with new stores opened this year in Beijing and Macau and a second store in Shanghai opening in December. Asia Pacific comps have gained 21% year-to-date.
Sales in Europe were also strong. Comparable store sales rose 21% in the quarter, which compared with a 1% decline last year and was above our expectations. London represents more than half of our European sales and we noted considerable strengthen all four stores there, as well as strength in our stores in Italy, France and Germany. This year, we opened our 14th retail location in Europe with a store in Vienna. We also completed the extensive renovation of our flagship store on Old Bond Street in July and since then sales have meaningfully increased in that important store. European comps have increased 20% in the year-to-date.
Rounding out international sales in the third quarter were solid increases in Canada and Latin America, and we are very much looking forward to opening a prominent Tiffany & Co. Store in Vancouver next week. 
Finally, Tiffany's other channel of distribution, which has several components, posted a 23% sales increase in the third quarter. More than half of that growth came from a meaningful and expected increase in wholesale sales of diamonds that are below our quality standards. As you know, our objective for these wholesale sales is to simply recoup our cost. 
Also in this channel, Little Switzerland sales rose 9% in the quarter, although that continued to be below our expectations. Lastly, a doubling of the Iridesse store base this year is contributing to their sales growth and we recently enhanced Iridesse.com when we launched e-commerce. So that covers our four channels of distribution. 
From an overall merchandising perspective, the sales strength in the quarter was concentrated more toward higher-end jewelry. There was substantial growth in diamond statement jewelry as well as in fine jewelry such as our Swing and Legacy collections with diamonds and colored stones; and, we saw double-digit growth in engagement jewelry in the U.S. and many international markets except Japan. 
It also looks like Celebration rings have become a perennial winner and we continue to expand that assortment with new designs. The designer jewelry category grew in the quarter fueled entirely by the incremental sales of Frank Gehry's jewelry collections which are exceeding our expectations. And of course, the 1837, Atlas and Return to Tiffany collections in gold and silver remain fashionable favorites.
Let's now look at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin of 53.6% in the third quarter was one-half point below the prior year and was slightly below our expectations. The decline was due to wholesale sales of diamonds and higher product costs, partly offset by sales leverage on fixed costs. We recorded a LIFO charge of $10.4 million in the quarter versus $4.2 million in last year's third quarter. We've increased retail prices in 2006 to address these cost pressures. 
SG&A expenses rose 8% in the quarter which was exactly what we expected and represented a moderation in year-over-year growth from the faster rate in the first half. The majority of the third quarter increase reflected anticipated store-related and marketing-related spending. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was 45.5% versus 46.1% in the third quarter a year ago. You should note that is SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2005 had included $4.3 million of charges related to business disposition.
Other expense net in the third quarter was actually income of $1.2 million instead of the typical net expense. The change was largely related to pre-tax gains of $5.2 million associated with the sale of equity investments in an online retailer and a manufacturer, both of which had been written off in previous years. We also realized a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.6 million on the disposition of some marketable securities. The after-tax benefit of these two gains was approximately $0.03 per diluted share. Without these various gains, other expense net would have been an expense of $5.5 million, or higher than the $4.3 million last year, due to interest expense on higher average borrowings. We expect a similar year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter.
Tiffany's effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35.6% compared with 33% in last year's third quarter. In both periods, we had favorable reserve adjustments relating to the expiration of certain statutory periods during the respective quarters, but the favorable effect was greater last year. So adding it all up, Tiffany's reported net earnings rose 23 % in the third quarter to $29.1 million or $0.21 per diluted share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim.
 
Thanks, Mark. All in all, we were pleased and encouraged with Tiffany's third quarter results. We achieved solid growth in the U.S. while strong growth in most international markets more than offset continued softness in Japan. On a trailing four quarter basis, return on average assets was 9% and return on average stockholders equity was 14%, both of which are close to the minimum long-term objectives we set for at least a 10% ROA and at least a 15% ROE. Tiffany has the financial strength, the infrastructure and the commitment to grow our business and the potential to meet or exceed our profitability targets. 
Let's look at Tiffany's balance sheet. At October 31, accounts receivable were up 16% over a year ago, partly due to sales growth and also reflecting some shift in credit card usage toward Tiffany's in-house card. In total, receivables are turning at a high 19 times per year. Net inventories at October 31 were 19% higher than a year ago and higher than initially planned, but part of the year-over-year increase can be attributed to an unusually low base in October of 2005. 
Higher raw material and work-in-process inventories were related to internal manufacturing and diamond sourcing activities. Higher precious metal costs also represented part of the increase. Higher finished goods were largely related to new stores and certain existing stores, as well as broadened product assortments. We now expect inventory levels to increase by a low double-digit percentage for the full year which is somewhat higher than our previous expectation. However, we do expect sales results to benefit from high in-store availability levels.
To support our business and sales growth, Tiffany's two distribution centers are also in very good shape. They are efficiently handling store replenishment requirements and are ready to accommodate the expected surge in e-commerce and catalogue orders in the next few weeks. 
Tiffany stepped up its pace of share repurchases in the third quarter, taking advantage of the recently increased authorization that was approved by our Board of Directors in August. We spent approximately $100 million to repurchase 3 million shares in the quarter, representing an average cost of $33.42 per share. Year-to-date, we've spent $264 million to repurchase 7.7 million shares representing approximately 5% of the shares outstanding at the start of the year. The current repurchase program expires in December of 2009 and we intend to act opportunistically in our share repurchase decisions.
We finished the quarter with $58 million of cash and cash equivalents, total short-term and long-term debt of $661 million and total stockholders equity of almost $1.7 billion. The ratio of total debt to stockholders equity was 39% at October 31st compared with 24% a year ago. The increase reflected borrowings for share repurchases and higher inventory levels. 
In today's press release, we increased our full-year earnings outlook to $1.79 to $1.84 per diluted share. To achieve that expectation, we are looking for total sales to increase approximately 10% for the year which includes U.S. comparable store sales growth in a mid single-digit range and international comp store sales on a constant exchange rate basis, growing in the high single-digit range.
We are now looking for gross margin for the year to be slightly lower than the prior year, which implies a decline in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect a high single-digit increase in SG&A expenses for the year with a similar rate of increase in the fourth quarter. We now expect other expenses net to be in the area of $13 million to $14 million for the year, which is lower than we originally thought at the start of the year, reflecting the gains in the third quarter. Excluding the gains recorded, other expenses net would be close to the $20 million we had expected. We also expect an effective tax rate of approximately 37% for the year.
We believe Tiffany is well prepared for this holiday season. Mark mentioned merchandising highlights in the third quarter. On a related note, we held an exhibition in our New York flagship store in the last week of October called Simply Spectacular. It was tied into the recent publication of our annual blue book and showcased the extraordinary jewelry shown in that book. I can tell you that there was considerable customer attendance at the one week exhibition and the interest shown has continued, certainly indicating customers willingness to spend. 
At more modest price points, charms are getting a renewed focus with a new twist at Tiffany. Based on customer requests, we've introduced a wide assortment of sterling silver charms for bracelets and necklaces, with a Tiffany exclusive lock mechanism that allows customers to make designs that reflect their own style. At higher price points, we have our new Tiffany Stars diamond collection with an assortment of styles. We certainly have exciting new designs at intermediate price points too, including Tiffany's new Novo diamond engagement ring, which is currently available in Japan and will be launched in the United States and other markets in early 2007.
Wrapping up my remarks, we are now almost halfway through the November-December holiday shopping season, at least from a calendar perspective. Tiffany's worldwide sales growth in November to date is currently running ahead of our expectation. Our expectation for the holiday season and fourth quarter includes U.S. Comp store sales increasing in the high single-digit range and international comps on a constant exchange rate basis growing in the mid single-digit range. We are currently exceeding those comp store sales expectations as well. 
Of course, keep in mind that the vast majority of Tiffany's holiday business to be transacted is still ahead of us in December, so we will not and would advise you not to extrapolate results in November to the entire holiday season and fourth quarter, but at least we are enjoying a good start.
We plan to update you on Tiffany's holiday sales results on January 10th. Until then, our best wishes to you for an enjoyable holiday season. 
That concludes this call. Of course, please feel free to call Mark with any questions or comments and thank you for listening.
 
Thank you. This concludes the conference.
